"""
This is a skeleton for a FastAPI application that interacts with an LLM which you can use as a starting point.
You need to host a FastAPI server to interact with the LLM. This server will receive requests from the client and send them to the LLM.
The server must definitely have the following endpoints:
- /generate: This endpoint will receive the request from the client, process it and send it to the LLM.
- /status: This endpoint will be used to check the status of the server.
