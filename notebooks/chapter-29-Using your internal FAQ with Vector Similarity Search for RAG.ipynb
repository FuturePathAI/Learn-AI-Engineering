    "\n",
    "- Admin Review Queue: New or flagged queries are sent to an admin review queue. Here, subject matter experts review the query to determine its relevance, accuracy, and the need for inclusion in the FAQ database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer Formulation and Approval: For each new query, the admin formulates a precise and comprehensive answer. This answer then undergoes a review process to ensure it meets the organization's standards for accuracy and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoding and Indexing: Once approved, the new Q&A pair is encoded into vectors using the same model as the rest of the FAQ database. The new vectors are then indexed to be searchable alongside existing entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database Update: The FAQ database is dynamically updated with the new Q&A pairs. This ensures that the system continuously evolves and adapts to new user queries and information trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous Learning: The system periodically reviews its performance and the relevance of its answers. Based on feedback and new information, it may prompt for reevaluation of certain Q&A pairs or the inclusion of additional information."
