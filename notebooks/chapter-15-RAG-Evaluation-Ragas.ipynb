    "\n",
    "The ragas library focuses on metrics that are directly applicable to RAG models. The metrics you mentioned are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Precision**: Measures the precision of the context retrieved by the RAG model. It evaluates how accurately the retrieved documents or context segments are relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faithfulness**: Assesses how faithfully the generated response represents the information in the retrieved documents. This is crucial in ensuring that the RAG model's output is not only relevant but also accurately reflects the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer Relevancy**: Evaluates the relevancy of the generated answer to the query. This is essential for tasks like question answering, where the goal is to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the retrieved context."

    "1. Context Recall:\n",
    "While precision focuses on the relevance of retrieved documents, recall assesses the model's ability to retrieve all relevant documents from the dataset. This is important in contexts where missing key information can lead to incomplete or inaccurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ROGUE:\n",
    "3. BLUE\n",
    "4. PERPLEXITY\n",
    "5. Logprobs from OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Retrieval Diversity:\n",
    "Evaluates the variety in the retrieved documents. High diversity ensures that the model is not just retrieving similar documents but is considering a wide range of potentially relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Query-Document Alignment:\n",
    "This involves assessing how well the model's query representation aligns with the document representations in its database. Misalignment can lead to retrieval errors, where the model retrieves documents that are semantically distant from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Ranking Accuracy:\n",
    "Evaluates how accurately the model ranks the retrieved documents in order of relevance. Higher-ranking accuracy ensures that the most relevant documents are considered first for generating responses."

It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money.\\nThe most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them.\\nWe needed to get experience as investors.
