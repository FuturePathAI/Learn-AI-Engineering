    "# What is Langchain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain is a Python framework for building and working with LLM APIs and related tools. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible. It introduces two new abstractions: chains and agents. Chains are \"invoked\", while agents are \"executed\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The framework has some bells and whistles: Langchain Expression Language (LCEL), used to describe the chains and inputs to it. And a paid service for request tracing called Langsmith."

    "2. Community: Vector Stores, Document Loaders\n",
    "3. Text Splitters, LLM APIs, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is designed to be powerful at the cost of being complex. It has happy paths for beginners, but primarily built with a lot of advanced features to enable experimentation. It is not a \"plug and play\" framework, but a \"plug and experiment\" one."

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.\\n\\nCSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations.
