So ""rights"" of the private owner, were taken away, while ""rights"" were given to the customer.

So in effect, the government is the one who defines the ""rights"" of citizens down to the most minute detail. That might be more scary, then ""if you don't like the store, or company to work for, go to another store or company"".",not toxic

Marriage is not between one man and one woman because the Church says so.  The Church teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman, because, marriage, by definition, by it's very nature, is a commitment between one man and one woman.  The Church teaches what manifestly IS.  The Church does not create reality with her teaching, church teaching is based on the nature of reality.  Gay marriage, is, by definition, an oxymoron.  

The Constitution, so far as I am aware (and I admit I am no elitist lawyer with a fancy degree from an elitist school) does not grant any of the three branches of government the power to redefine reality based on the whims of pop-culture.

It is obvious that the Police vessel made a very bad decision resulting in damages. They should be held to account either monetarily and a public admission of responsibility in this breach of maritime regulation on the river. 
What were they thinking? Would be interesting to know. I see the rebuttal make little sense given the situation. I would push it. Make them apologist and pay for the damages. As long as it doesn't interfere with the scheduled.

She says there is a ""factual truth"" and an ""emotional truth"", and that ""psychologists tell us"" that most of us make (most? all?) our decisions based on ""feelings"". Do we then need to call it ""emotional"" truth? Let's leave out the ""truth part, and admit those decisions have little fact or truth, but only the strength of our emotions, and as such are apt often to go badly wrong; we see the results in the pages of our newspapers every day. ""Emotional truth"" led to witch burnings, the murders of heretics in inquisitions, the massacres and enslavement of peoples we ""felt"" were subhuman, and today, the incorrect ""emotional truth"" that persons with dark skin, another religion, or both, are murderers at the very least.

Facts can be manipulated; we call that ""lying"". ""Emotional truth"", though it be deplorable bigotry, can be used by a strong man to gain and keep power at the expense of his sad mob of losers.",not toxic

But the comparison ends there because of the clear difference between the plight of indigenous Americans compared to Hawaiians. Indigenous Americans lived in tribes which claimed various areas of North America. They never unified as a single nation.

Hawaiians were always unified as one people and one nation even despite the internecine conflicts among chiefs to establish dominance, conflicts which ended when Kamehameha the great unified all of the islands under his singular rule to establish the kingdom and nation of Hawai'i.

The US NEVER legally annexed Hawai'i so it NEVER established legal authority or jurisdiction over Hawaii. The Kingdom of Hawai'i continues to exist as the ONLY lawful government of Hawai'i",not toxic

Yours is a circular argument that has to believe YOU personally know the mind of God, which you do not.    You quote human/church scripture out of context and remove the many other ways in which God reveals his love for his/her imperfect children outside of the walls of a church.

Your faith is your own and if it makes you a more loving and compassionate person, they I would say you are fed by the Fruits of the Spirit.  I can't know your heart, I'll leave that judgement to another source.

If Congress declines to investigate Flynn's purpose in talking with Russian embassy spies before the election, and if Trump can weather that storm, then he can survive. On the other hand, if rats keep deserting the doomed ship, at a certain point this administration will fall apart from attrition.

We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth.""

Yes. Every president has created and engaged in his own war(s). Obama has been no different. The drone wars, the war against ISIS, the War on Libya, dabbling in the war on Syria, and some covert wars in North African nations such as Somalia.

It was clear from the start of Obama's presidency that unless his large base of hopeful supporters remained mobilized and engaged in demanding change, Obama would be unable to make more than perfunctory change.",not toxic

The stance AST is taking right now with Girdwood is the exact same stance they took in the early 1990s with the Hillside, that it's not their responsibility to provide general policing services to an incorporated municipality with police powers.  They're doing this knowing full well that the MOA is doing its part to comply with state law in taking the stance they're taking.  Like with the early 1990s, it's a scare tactic to get voters to accept areawide police powers or a rough equivalent.

""[examined] 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.""

Note that these abstracts included papers from the 90's, when the science was far less certain.  In the past 30 years, the consensus has moved to essentially 100%.

1139,"A problem that has come up a few times occurs when a vehicle turning right doesn't see the cyclist bombing along with an equally unobservant cyclist. The cyclist will lose, every time. The green lane only serves to give some of them an unhealthy sense of stupidness. The lanes should be yellow so everyone takes extra caution at a potentially dangerous location.

On a related note; we have a few councils around who are pushing the bicycle lanes with little to show they are needed. I'm out and about every day but rarely see any cyclists in the full vehicle sized lanes they are granted. They also don't need to be on a major artery where traffic is already over crowded. Pushing them a block or two over will keep them safer. Total access isn't a requirement simply because they whine about it.

If safety was the true reason then cyclists would not pass vehicles but rather travel in line like everyone else and take their turn in sequence. I see it happening but often enough.",not toxic

The failure of the bishops to provide a strong system of accountability within the church, placed into question all of the church's teachings on Justice, on compassion, and perhaps all, the very concept of bishops as shepherds.  That internal failure was an abandonment of the higher moral path preached by the church, leaving justice and accountability at the much lower bar set by secular law.  

If that alone weren't bad enough, they then fought against even that lower bar at every level...

A key phrase in what you said was ""the church... doesn't seem to want to fit...""  This response was and CONTINUES to be a choice.  A choice that troubles and corrodes.  Kieran's point focuses in on one in a long string of choices bishops and pope's made, and continue to make.

Life is full of risks, often necessitating that we make choices to turn this way or that way. To chose to believe in any Superior Being is a risky venture. To chose to not believe in any Superior Being is also a risky venture.
It takes courage to make that choice, because if we chose wrong, the outcome may prove to be costly. Even if there is no after-life, our choice could cost us dearly in this life.
And if, in the long run, it doesn't really matter, that we live an ultimately futile existence, just as any other critter, then our present choices serve to make us take stock of matters greater than ourselves ... it makes us human.

It won't be easy and will certainly take many years if not decades to play out, but if Warmbier’s family is willing to grasp at straws, then the only recourse I see is for them to begin a grass roots movement to have our government formally reestablish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.  If such were to happen, then a lawsuit against the government of North Korea could next be filed in a U.S. federal court with the ultimate goal being a seizure of any assets should North Korea someday wish to engage in commerce with or within the borders of the United States.

It's sobering to realize that no monetary penalty eventually won, however large, would ever be likely to restore their son to them as he once was.

Resume Harper's unquestioning support for right-wing Israeli governments in creating a ""greater Israel"" and oppressing Palestinians? That's an inhumane and unworthy idea.

They had to make an economic go of it because there was no welfare; no ""nanny state"" to bail them out.  No job?  They didn't eat.  Back then, immigrants were not the financial burden that they are today if they fail, and many do fail at supporting themselves.  So if you want to harken back to the ""good old days"" of rampant immigration, then we should also make sure these newcomers and their families don't get the taxpayer support we can't even afford due to our reckless overspending and expanding national debt.

Germany uses the Euro, weakened by the other economies, to export BMW's  by the millions along with Mercedes. If Germany reverted to the Mark, they couldn't sell their beautiful cars in America.

It seems likely to me, a layperson in the matter, that urban and suburban population densities are not possible without immunization and other public health programs like water treatment. Ants seem to be able to live in very high population densities, but humans and other large mammals and birds cannot. Ask any farmer about farm animals, and what a risk it is to bring a non-immunized animal into the herd. If the herd is not nearly completely immunized, and the new animal is carrying a communicable disease, the herd could all be gone in a month.

That is, are we going to tax the income of those who create it in order to pay a dividend?  But it's not that simple.  Alaska has a large population of people who live a subsistence lifestyle below poverty levels.  The dividend means much more to this population than folks living in Anchorage making say $50,000/year.  Federal and state policies have enabled and subsidized this subsistence population.  New reality option:  carve out $7 billion from Perm Fund and name it the ""Alaska Subsistence Welfare Fund"" to pay $1250/year to Alaska natives who live at poverty levels in villages. Drop dividend payments to everyone else and use the remainder of the Perm Fund to run the state.

Hawaii is very different from the Native Americans because they had census taken from almost the beginning. The Ancestral Ohana Names are well documented. For now, verifiable ancestral heritage is the most used, DNA only starting to be used. (Lower Case) native Hawaiian is anybody born in Hawaii, with accompanied state right, without 50% blood quantum. The State often announces they are only in stewardship of these lands until they are returned to the Native Hawaiians. The top of Mauna Kea is Ancestral Kanu'ana Aina, kapu to even talk about.",not toxic

Blister reviewers are experienced and still have their weaknesses. I recommend looking the podcast up on blistergearreview.com. 

They all agreed that instead of having the mindset on the hazards, they worried if they'd get to ski their line.  I'm glad you can see obvious hazards, but experience engenders familiarity, which can lead to bad decisions based on overlooked obvious in hindsight hazards.

But that reduction in spending can come with a price of its own: The most effective way to hold down health-care costs is to limit the availability of care. Some other developed countries ration care directly. Some spend less on facilities, technology, or physician incomes, leading to long waits for care. Such trade-offs are not inherently bad, and not all health care is of equal value, though that would seem to be a determination most appropriately made by patients rather than the government. But the fact remains that no health care system anywhere in the world provides everyone with unlimited care.

Right there you show you don't know anything. The exchange rate being ""OK"" ie. the 1 CAD was closer to 1 USD would not be an advantage to a physician returning to Canada. It would be a disadvantage.

With the Canadian dollar lower now it is more to the advantage of someone in the US selling their assets - home etc. - and moving to Canada. Those US assets are worth more compared to the Canadian equivalent now that the dollar has fallen. Income from US investments are worth more now when converted to Canadian dollars than if the Canadian $ was closer to par.

Similarly, selling your Canadian house, etc. and taking those Canadian dollars to the US costs you more now. Now that the CAD has fallen moving to the US is a more expensive proposition. And once you're there with both your income and expenses in US$ it no longer matters one way or the other what the exchange rate is.",not toxic

Compare the bit coin miner to a real miner. The mined product is a solution to a pointless math problem that ties up massive computational  power. What more do you need to know? 

The process is destructive. Obscene amounts of energy are wasted while real problems in need of solution could be solved. The apparent success of Bitcoin is nothing more than the dumbing down of humans at the speed of light.

Sessions has also pushed forward with a revived War on Drugs which isn’t at all based in any reality other than he desperately wants to lock up as many poor people and people of color as possible.

If you only count those shootings with AR-15s, then yes, you have only AR-15s to count. However, if you look at the actual data collected by Mother Jones and provided in the link I gave you, the data shows that handguns indeed are used more often than any other class of firearms in mass shootings. It's not even arguable.

It will kill Alaska’s economy and shut down TAPS and cause the people to lose all the Permanent fund in a few short years!

Not one Alaskan or smaller company has found and sold oil at a profit, do you see a problem with that? Help Alaskans and smaller oil companies fairly compete and stop the big three monopoly & the CBC!

The EXXON-VALDEX in one event literally destroyed an ecosystem for the short term and continues to destroy many species.  The pipeline was monitored throughout the building to require the safest possible construction by government oversight and environmental activists.  Government monitoring provided more jobs than the pipeline. Many spills including the explosion of one station occurred soon after startup and continue to occur as more workers are jettisoned to monitor.  One rifle slug punched a hole in it.  The DAPL is accessible throughout by roads and in highly populated areas.  Rich farmlands abound and all depend on water.  One spill could be disastrous as none of the safety factors built into the AK pipeline exist in lower 48 pipelines.  Multiple spills and blowouts have occurred as safety is secondary to profit.

3547,"3. On pistols and magazine capacity: In 2016, 73% of murders were committed with a firearm.  Only 4% of these were rifles or shotguns (FBI data). However, pistols are also a great self-defense tool.  According to a US Dept of Justice study, firearms are used to prevent crime victimization up to 150,000 times per year. Other studies indicate higher rates. The pistol is the most common firearm used to do prevent crime, too. It's highly portable and concealable (which is good for law-abiding citizens... not so good for criminals).  The question really becomes - do we prohibit law-abiding citizens from the use of pistols used tens of thousands of times per year in defense of themselves because of criminals?  

Magazines are easily and quickly changed. A determined and practiced killer can still carry many hundreds of rounds regardless of whether the magazine capacity is 5, 10 or 15. He just carries more magazines. Reloading takes a matter of seconds if you practice.

An obvious difference between Pres Obama and Trump is their capacity to communicate; Barack explaining and motivating to an informed citizenry or Donald spouting nonsense and alienation. 
Words matter,  and ones ability to express themselves is a first order skill that needs constant honing, especially to an important elected official. 
Mazie may be a sympath,  and that can be reassuring.  And when provided questions she clearly has the ability to read them in a committe speaking truth to power. 
But if she shows up at a town hall meeting, purporting to be a member of the ""resistance"", she should be prepped sufficient to build the crowds confidence in her capacities and leadership.  Answers matter,  a lot.  They build hope

 You claim you're the expert on Alaska budgetary policy.

To quote you:   You're the ""primary resource for credible authoritative Alaska policy research"".

One might assume that one who claims to be an expert would have the ability to read and comprehend the numbers in a budget.

Here you're saying you don't know how to find the answer to your question?

You want the 'author' to provide it for you?

What 'author' provides you with your 'answers' you dispense from your 'think tank'?

Saying that you'll bring green jobs to town is not reassuring when, thus far, those jobs are 10 people here and 30 people there and require years of retraining and certification.  When someone plunks a battery gigafactory in Appalachia instead of the desert of a state that has never had a significant coal mine or builds a windmill plant near Hayden or Paonia instead of near a college town that didn't really need the jobs, then maybe the message will ring true with coal miners.

They have made him a pariah no matter what he does. 
I can't  believe that this hysteria over controlling America's borders is genuine concern. The person in your parliament who called Trump a fascist or some similar incident.... What does he think he's referring to? Why didn't someone say ""How so?"".  How would he answer? I don't think I have read a post or an article that condemns the U.S. for this that actually articulates what it is that's so upsetting. These frantic people are losing support in the U.S. now.

The Liberals are promising to cap bridge tolls at $500, however they have not said that they may well tax all crossings to make up for the lost revenue. Some pay less, and some pay that never paid before. 

MSP premiums were raised by the BC Liberals past the point of equitable fairness (considering politicians and public sector workers have their premiums  employer paid). The BC Liberals may well eliminate premiums, but no guarantee this will not be made up for by an income tax levy similar to Ontario.

We could withstand and survive even a Trump presidency, although I am certain he wouldn't survive his first year in office.  But not to worry.  All of the projections and analysis show that Sec. Clinton will be sworn-in as President on January 20, 2017.  We are not a nation of fools, as the radical right would have us all believe.

3918,"It is an interesting debate.  I'm certainly a strong supporter of property rights, but there is a balance that's necessary when you have many land owners in close proximity to each other because there is some spill-over affect.  That's why we have cites/towns, and rural areas.  The choice to own land in a city/town comes with the knowledge that property development will have more limits places on it (zoning) as compared to rural land ownership where there aren't nearly as many close-proximity neighbors.

Now, while that is a justification for zoning in cities/towns, it's not an endorsement of extreme zoning limitations.  I still favor only modest limits applied by zoning.  Land owners still ought to have quite a bit of leeway with what they can do with their property.  But there are some big things that warrant limits to keep character of the city/town intact.",not toxic

However Mansbridge's retirement is likely the end of an era. The major evening  news format has become outdated. No-one wants to wait for a set time each day to find out from one figurehead person what is going on at home and around the world. The 24/7 News channels are much more relevant to people now.  So kudo's to the CBC for looking at a different way of delivering the daily news. I hope that includes seeing the CBC break more stories that matter to all Canadians.. The taxpayers deserve it.

Their record in reg sees them 7th overall.  7th is closer to 10th than 1st.

In goal dif, 8th.  8th is closer to 10th than 1st.

What's distorting their record to the + is their 13-9 record in extras--nothing fantastic, but it's better than those other teams around them that you dismiss.

As Johnny Dollar has posted all season, Vos Canadiens are a top 10 team in a watered-down salary cap NHL which has way too many teams.  But closer to 10th than to 1st.

And Lamont Cranston couldn't carry Boston Blackie's jockstrap.  Nor did he need strange mystical powers in order to thwart crime.

Minnesota definitely looked ready to start the season and Hawaii seemed to have left their indoor game performance out on the beach and sand.

All of them come with the bias that they have been raised with, and all of them will experience the painful process of learning about prejudice.

Society is innately homogenous in it's pristine state, and our public education system has been built on that foundation.  Public education should continue to support that ideal.

So the proper realistic interest rate for a mortgage rate is 6, and that is where we are going to eventually get, sooner then later.  Better for the homeowner to prepare for this eventuality.  Also, the price of a home is overvalued by say 300,000 on a million dollar home, what sense does it make to loan 700,000? People don't buy houses lenders buy houses.

Most of these ""treatment centers"" have fortunately been closed as useless.  Some have admitted their mistake and attempt to treat other psychological problems.  Yet Bishops even today use the idea that they were misled by psychologists.  Too bad they did not consult with the women Catholic Social Workers trained in their own institutions about these problems.  It could have headed off this scandal.  Yet Bishops were willing to pay to keep these specially ordained men in the ranks.  They were willing to stand up for their own clergy before they were willing to protect our children.

Read Salvifici Dolores to better understand the proper Christian understanding of pain, which is at great variance from your view. 

There is a spectrum of pain & Church teaching accommodates all points in the spectrum beautifully.  None of my points depart from this teaching. 

Some forms of ""ordinary pain"" (getting up, common colds, twisted ankles,  applying exactitude to finish a job well, sore necks, stiff backs, tingly fingers from stenosis, etc.) are perfect examples where a Christian can brace up a bit, & draw closer to union with Jesus in that moment of pain.    Offering the little pain for reparation, in thanksgiving, etc.

It takes a bit of practice; but the intimacy with Christ is dear.

The heartless, greedy bastards made the bill more heartless so as to get on board the extreme right and that made it A okay with Young? People will suffer and die just so that Paul Ryan and political animals like Young can give a massive tax cut to the uber wealthy of this once great nation.

Fortunately, we don’t need to “define down” the fuller message of the gospel because Jesus did it for us, and in only four sentences: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind and with all your strength. This is the greatest and first commandment. And the second is like it, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and all the prophets” (Matthew 22:36-40 & Mark 12:28-31”.

Meanwhile, the 'first female president' glass ceiling remains intact.  Hillary failed. Her political career is over and her hubris checked.  Only time will tell if the Democrats' notion of that title will be filled by a Democrat or, the gods forbid, (smile) ....... a Republican!",not toxic

If that is so, perhaps The Clown Prince should have said that we will grow the economy outward from our butts instead of from our hearts.  And while I agree that Butts is by far the brainier of this duo, the PM's  arrogance, petulance, impatience to get his own way and disdain for others is inherited from Papa Pierre.  So Trudeau 2.0 shares the blame and is ultimately responsible for the cynical power grab machinations since he was elected and cannot simply pass the buck to Butts.  

But thanks for reminding me of the popular British sitcom ""Yes, Prime Minister"" in which the chief of staff/permanent secretary Sir Humphrey wears the long pants and the PM is basically a shallow figurehead.

The jealousy appears partly due to Trudeau being so good at impromptu photo ops while the Harperites were just awful at all their ""government by visual"" manipulations including their dreadful channel 24/7/.

Several weeks ago the Oregon legislature’s economists in the Legislative Revenue Office (LRO) came out with an estimate of how the proposal to raise taxes on large, mainly out-of-state corporations would impact the Oregon economy….

While the report fantasizes that a little bit of the costs will be passed along to consumers (another number well within the margin of error in a five year projection), its authors acknowledge the report did not consider the impact of internet sales and other factors that would limit the ability of affected corporations to stick consumers with the bill….
The decision whether to raise taxes on large, mainly out-of-state corporations is too important to be based on fantastic estimates. Oregonians need facts they can rely on — such as the fact that Oregon corporate taxes have declined dramatically over the decades.

The difference between Helfrich and Altman as head coaches in terms of length of tenure isn't an issue because a coach's reputation doesn't just start the minute he's a head coach somewhere. It's about how your peers evaluate you, in and out of the conference. Helfrich has been a coach in the Pac-12 before Oregon.

According to you Canada 'stood out' by getting a UN resolution passed to condemn atrocities in Aleppo and saying someone should investigate them.

That's not exactly 'standing out' by any definition of the term nor does it explain why Canada should be the chosen one to get international justice in Syria much less do it now.

The ICC has Canada under investigation for committing its own war atrocities in Afghanistan. The UN itself found Canada to be guilty of denying human rights to its own citizens. Your recent sale of billions of dollars of arms to Saudi Arabia, the worst human rights violator in the world has gotten Canada condemned by every human rights organization that hears about it.  This article is a white wash of Canadian behavior, indoctrinates Canadians in believing myths and  contributes to the UN being a mockery.

You claim to have taught anything contrary to the Church, yet recently stated this:

""I’m a gay man. If I wasn’t a priest and I met somebody for me who was a soul mate, who I enjoyed being with, who had all the things somebody who is marrying looks for in a relationship, I’d want to be married. I’d want to have the ability to marry that person. I’m a priest, so I took a vow of celibacy.

5930,"Brian,
Thank you for the nice words.  My article was sincere in that ultimately, having two or more strong, but sensible political parties is needed to keep a Democracy alive.  The highest form of Government, is a Representative type of system where the leaders (full of imperfect humans) are running the show in a way that We The People approve of.  Too many years of the divide becoming wider and wider - especially in the last 8 years - is why Donald Trump became elected.   Too much centralized power leads to Tyranny (i.e. failure).  That was the Legacy of Obama.  When asked who will I vote for: I always reply, start with the understanding that Liberty & Freedom is what Humans yearn for.  The farthest from that is forms of Tyranny.  Whoever will pursue polices closer to the former, gets my vote.   That is why I voted for Donald Trump.  Not Donald himself, but his promised policies were/are closer to the necessary cure for our ailing Country, than what Hillary wanted to do.

Secondly,  it is wonderfully entertaining  and  deftly  lampoons  the creator, CBC, over its objectives and motives  -  casually  revising history using emphasis or not; for example,what about the settlements in Nova Scotia ? Also, I was disappointed in the depiction of Champlain, who in my view was a giant in our history, although  to give credit he was at least included. A cameo appearance by  the PM was a bit much.

But, life is still politics.  This healthcare thing is a powerful lesson in that.  
Trump took a political ""certainty"" (repeal of Obamacare by a GOP that controlled both houses of Congress and the WH) and politically undermined it.  
It started back in 2016, when he turned repeal into an unthinking imperative.  That was a mistake born of ignorance.  He did not understand healthcare complexities.  He (and the GOP) should have heralded a more deliberate approach instead of an ""immediate"" ""first act on first day of my Presidency"" approach.
Along the way, he cemented the failure.  He attacked so many, it is surprising 49 GOP Senators actually voted ""Yes"" last night.  Ultimately, his misogyny and politics of personal insult lost him Collins, Murkowski and finally McCain.

We have a president who neither understands nor respects the basic norms of American democracy. Make no mistake: Donald Trump is a true aberration. There is no figure like him in U.S. history, for which we should be thankful.
Trump’s inexperience is unique; he is the only president never to have served in government or the military. This weakness is exponentially compounded by his ignorance of both policy and process, his lack of curiosity, his inability to focus and his tremendous insecurity. He refuses to acknowledge his shortcomings, let alone come to terms with them; and he desperately craves the kind of sycophantic adulation that George Washington, a genuine hero, pointedly rejected.

The middle class has already earned its benefit, which you confuse as separate matters. By definition, the middle-class cannot rob itself. Rather, repeal destroys tax revenues originating virtually entirely among the rich, particularly the very rich.

But I do sympathize with your desperation to portray taxation on the wealthy as something else, voters having little sympathy to the plight of the uber-wealthy.

Some of us are ""nationalistic"" and love America and everything it stands for.  Some of us stand for obeying natural law (anti-abortion) as well as civic law (immigration laws).  If you agree with Planned Parenthood doublespeak and open borders, write your congressman.  But don't pretend to be compassionate without accepting the responsibility that comes with it.",not toxic

The ""State of Hawaii"" was created by the laws of a foreign government (US) in direct violation of its own constitution which limits the authority and jurisdiction of its laws to within its own borders. In Hawai'i's case the Hawaii Admissions Act (HHA), (the Statehood Act), unconstitutionally created a US state from a foreign nation, Hawaii. The unconstitutionality of the HHA is based on the FACT that the US NEVER legally annexed Hawai'i, a FACT supported by the 1989 US DOJ investigation into the legality of the US' claim of legal annexation.

Since the 1893 illegal takeover of Hawai'i by 13 white supremacists led by Lowell Thurston many ali'i trusts have been raided by their trustees and boards of directors in violation of their fiduciary responsibility including the Crown Trust by the ""State"".

She had no intention of voting in two states, although she did wonder aloud if every college graduate and student who had been unwittingly registered in two states might have swung the election against Trump had they known.

On the voter rolls when I sign my name, I can look down & see that there are at least three people listed who have been dead for multiple years.

Since a growing number of science and technology, business, and government experts now think the end of full employment will increase in likelihood over the next 20 years and beyond, I think now is the time to think through our options proactively, rather than ignore or deny this possibility and then try to cope with such a profound change after the fact--when cooler heads are unlikely to prevail.

There is a very good legal reason why refugee claimants (not asylum seekers which are a completely different class of persons) are not being charged in respect of their entry to Canada.

Under Article 31 of the 1951 Convention on Refugees Canada has undertaken to not prosecute refugee claimants for illegal entry into Canada including any issues of false documents or fraud relating to that entry.

Canada has enacted that exemption into our domestic law as required by the Convention in various iterations of our immigration legislation over the years. Currently that exemption is contained at s. 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.

The comparison between Ford and Trump is weak. Trump grew up in a privileged world and lived much of his life above others in Trump Tower. Rob Ford, although from a wealthy family, lived just blocks away from the towers of the inner suburbs. He continued to live in the area. He went to public school in the area.

When we rented for 6 years in Calgary, the Landlords were 2,000 miles away and it was ""out of sight, out of mind."" Amazing phenomenon for us, as renters.  We really felt the urge to repaint, do minor repairs and things and laughed and said, ""hey! We we're only renting! Screw it.""  Talked to landlords once about buying the place.  Oh, man!  The improvements we would make: develop the basement, maybe. Garage in the back. New patio or deck.  Then we thought of the dollars that would take. Wow!  Moved out instead, bought a nearly-new place that was absolutely right--not one buck in ""Improvements"" or renovations needed. All done (developed basement, built-in shelves in the garage, storage bins, big deck umbrella, barbecue)...all part of the price of the home.

Agreed, we are discussing issues prior to original sin. I am using Last Common Ancestor in the sense used by geneticists in developing trees of life. That perspective sees no discontinuity at any point in evolution, and most certainly does not entertain our specific religious problem of ensoulment, a necessary and irreducible discontinuity from our perspective. 

In imagining, in speculating, about a solution, I accept direct creation by Yahweh in the sense of ensoulment as inescapable, but see no reason to imagine the direct creation of the bodies of our earliest ancestors (which you seem to see as required?). Indeed, Yahweh directly creates everyone of us in the womb by a similar act of direct creation, of ensoulment of sexually reproduced biological matter. I suggest that once one ponders the equivalence of that first ensoulment and all subsequent ensoulments, each an instance of direct creation, then the starting point disappears as a problem.

7987,"Rep Johnston, please fix the broken oil and gas system that prices and BLOCKS Alaskans and smaller competitors out of business and makes Alaska the worst place in the nation to profit from by finding and selling oil, even ConocoPhillips lost money and they seem to own almost everything.
The low price of oil is not the real problem in Alaska oil business, it is the poor management of state oil & gas lands based on my 30 years in the oil business I have seen them try to pick winners and losers and they have no crystal ball but still they play God and violate the constitution and the oil and gas laws everyday. The people have to stop them from Blocking smaller oil competitors for the majors. The facts are clear they must be looked at as they give the people of Alaska's oil wealth away!
Will someone wake the people of Alaska and change the laws so Alaskans can drill and profit
Put the people first and Alaska will prosper and get rid of those that sell the people out. Lets drill baby drill",not toxic
