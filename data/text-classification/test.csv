17,"Good for you Looking for checking out the data.  If you've found the current population you know California is some 8% black, Washington 5% and Oregon 3%.  Cal is at about three million, Wash about a third of a million, and us just over 116,000.  Way up from 128  (0.24%) in 1860!

You ask: how did those blacks get here earlier  if it was against the law?   Good  question. The answer, the law was only casually enforced.  The law impacted but did not eliminate ""free Negroes"" coming here.  (think of our earlier Marijuana laws) Only Jacob Vanderpool was evicted while George Bush chose to move to Wash to be free of such laws..

As Nokes notes in ""Breaking Chains""  (good book you should read ) there were up to 50 slaves in Oregon, again in spite  of the anti-slavery laws.  Regarding the exclusion laws he states ""But while the exclusion laws were rarely enforced in Oregon, the tragic legacy of the laws  was that they discouraged blacks  from coming at all. (p 171)"
18,What currencies or cards do you support for topping up?
19,"When I made a purchase last Saturday, I was charged extra. Did I receive the right exchange rate?"
20,"Yes, the climate has changed many times during the past 4.5B years. Each time, the extant species have paid a terrible price. We are the first species who can do something about the prospect of yet another extinction.
Is it your position that we shouldn't?"
21,"Thank-you for the clarification Ronald.  I just learned something.
Another question.  If I have US cash in a US domiciled bank account I understand that I have to report it on T1135.  But what if the cash is held in a Canadian domiciled account?"

29,"We are an export nation. So what's your plan to increase our exports? Keep killing trade deals?

You mention a lot of lofty notions, but not one concrete idea of how to help our exporters reach new markets."
30,I agree that the industrial harvesting of our forests exceeds nature's (and ours) ability to regenerate them. Which is why our provinces should foster the expansion of the forests in the 'battle' against 'climate change'. Take positive action instead of punitive action. Greenpeace needs to use facts with logical argument instead of hyperbole to foster hysteria. I believe that they and most so-called 'environmentalists' are incapable of that.
31,give me a weather report for las vegas
32,"Please explain why this event requires an endorsement for any kind of protest. Campaign visits to Eugene by presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were met here with lollipops and rainbows (and in the latter case, ice cream cones and a basketball jersey). Upon each's somber return in the wake of the Thurston and UCC shootings, protestors were derided for not respecting the office; you were near the front of that parade of criticism last fall.

I'm not 73, have never protested anything and have never believed telling others how to live is being a good neighbor, never mind a responsible citizen. However, I've long had a fascination with successful people, regardless of their political stripe, who somehow possess the mettle to move mountains. That includes Clinton and Obama, among many others.

Like it or not, Trump has accomplished something quite remarkable. That flaccid guarantee of contentiousness for his visit is not."
33,"It is time for the good senator to knuckle under, eat some humble pie, and back off of her high horse. If she does not, and this impasse remains, nobody will like the outcome which will be very very big bucks to stop work......stopping work on this hummer will not be free, and should it be restarted you can kiss an extra billion goodbye. It is best to finish this monstrosity, see how it goes, and if we don't like it we can tear it down, and as somebody said, used the rubble for shoreline protection against sea level rise."

This can't be said for such airports as San Francisco and Chicago O'Hare to name a few. Did I mention that DIA is the most modern airport in the United States? I think we have it covered here Harpro, thanks bro."

61,"The Fair Labor Association (FLA) is funded by brands like Adidas (and formerly Nike) and therefore can't be trusted to cite and remediate labor violations found in subcontracted factories. If Nike is so confident about working conditions in its subcontracted factories, why is the brand refusing access to the ONLY truly independent labor watchdog organization?? Nike has a long history of labor and human rights violations and should be carefully monitored at all times like every other apparel brand. I'm proud that the UW is taking a stand for the hundred of thousands of garment workers around the world who deserve jobs with dignity and I'm proud to be a UW Alumni!"

72,The 2 million dollar plus homes are not selling well now in Vancouver so who are all these Vancouverites that are supposedly down scaling to Victoria and buying?  Few Vancouverites can move here if they can't find jobs to transfer to so it's got to be foreignors that are driving up the prices.  There is hardly anything for a retiree to buy here apart from condo apartments.  Estate sale properties in original condition sell for 1200K and then it takes another 700-800 K to build new.    The inventory here is scant and terrible quality.  Time to bring in the foreign real estate tax now so builders can provide buyers with new detached homes !!!  Victoria needs a complete overhall in building.

81,"According to the followers of the Teleprompter Jesus™, two term Obama was persecuted just for being black while president, so it comes as no surprise that the biggest news of the day for the anti-Trumpers isn’t the $110 billion arms deal with the Saudis, but a glowing orb from a Harry Potter movie. Secretly, they’re just angry that Obama wasn’t invited to touch the Magic Muslim 8 ball, after he kissed their behinds."

And the ones killing their rival drug dealers and pimps (mostly black victims, of course) are still going to prison.

87,"It goes without saying that a parent will want the best education possible for their children. The only limit is what they can afford. It also comes down to a matter of trust. If I have the money will I send my kids to an established private school with a 100% pass rate (administered and adjudicated by international standards), or take a chance on a public school, where my school fees are  paid effectively to the government, and hope that my fees will lead to an upliftment of my chosen school?

102,"eloisa, were you an english teacher by chance? is it really one of the most wonderful cities on earth? the inequality in london is worse than in honolulu. homelessness, destitution, racial, religious and ethnic divisions, poverty. those palaces were built with money stolen from countries around the world. those titles were unearned, unless you consider murder, rape, pillage and destruction of whole communities and countries as work. the internet has taken the blinders off, the young, and some old people too can now get the unvarnished truth about everything. hopefully they will see through the 'royal' bs we have been fed for centuries and begin repairing their world."
103,"Homeowners can defer their property taxes and the only penalty is simple (i.e. non-compounding) interest at a low rate.

Would-be homeowners can pillage their RRSPs and get new buyer grants.

Taxpayers guarantee mortgage loans to the tune of nearly a Trillion dollars now nation-wide, encouraging market participation and reinforcing market gains.

Etc.

Enhancing the on-paper wealth of home owners has been a fixation of governments at all levels. Increasingly special treatment for people's housing investments - relative to other investments - has been the status quo for a long time.

BC won't have hope of building other facets of its economy or retaining its future tax base until this trend is reversed. Yet a lot of people feel entitled to this sort of support. (It remains odd to see people un-ironically call tightened CMHC rules that REDUCE the taxpayer footprint in the market ""s.o.c.i.a.l.i.s.m."".) I'm not holding my breath that things will change."

109,"So the headline is for the uninformed and not for the critical thinker. How many people suffer from transgender issues? How many males may have issues with their plumbing? 

So the military has about 700k active males give or take. That does not include those who have served and are covered under the VA system. Several million men.

How many hundred or thousands of people are looking for transgender services? They are a fraction of a percent of the population. Yes less than one percent but spend how much? No wonder they spend 5 times on Viagra. If you even attempt to cling to this article to justify the transgender experiment you are not capable of critical thinking.

There are how many more thousands of individuals who may need Viagra than who need transgender treatments. As a portion of the population the transgender people are consuming more resources.

This is not an apples to apples comparison, but rather a headline trying to sway the easily fooled."

Remember when the airport signage was changed, causing massive problems? Airport management finally admitted what we already know, utterly incompetent.

Remember the parking and Wiki Wiki bus Nazis?

What I think is great is that legal charges of treason need not be involved for Trump and the Republicans who are involved in or who attempt to cover up evidence because it's politically damaging to be viewed as un-American or ""traitors"" to American democracy in the minds of citizens. What's really great about the disgusting mess Republicans are making of the nation is that Republicans are on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the rule of law. This is the party that brought us Pro-life terrorism, stole healthcare from Americans and who put a filthy, genital grabbing tv celebrity in the White House who is now using the office to enrich his already disgustingly-rich family at the expense of all Americans.

208,Fully automatic weapons are illegal and can only be purchased through the black market. The guy in Vegas could not have done that alone and likly had help and was radicalized by ISIS or ANTIFA.

And where did he get his Millions since his last job was a postal worker. Yea he went postal alright but had to have help. You can only shoot 1 gun at a time so 500 wounded and 58 dead sounds more like an attack carried out by a bunch of mercenaries. Not the Lone Wolf Lie they are selling the sheep.

You have no private life, you have to live in two cities, you don't get paid a whole lot considering the responsibility, and now you are not allowed to choose to walk away after 13 years?

298,"There's nothing Substantive in your argument to address. Currently Peruta is awaiting rehearing before the 9th en banc, thus also Richards and Prieto. As it stands, carry is a right in the 9th, if suspended pending. At any rate, try answering my central challenge to your primary claim. If the law has not been enforced, nor even really acknowledged, by state and local LEO, much less Fed, for the past 12 yrs, and hasn't resulted in local/state conflict in that time in Anchorage nor AK, on what rational basis do you claim it will suddenly be an issue if the same situation extends to the UAA campus? Your specious legal theory fails in any analysis of actual practice, both here and everywhere else, ie the majority of states, where permitless carry, both concealed and open, has existed since long before the GFSZA passed.

350,"Poor advice, Mr. Carrick:  a bean counter's perspective, and people are not beans.  Becoming educated cannot be equated with seeking a job.  A student should do a program in which he or she is interested, and even more or less passionate about.  Parents who tell their children otherwise risk bad results at university, drug-taking, depression, and dropping out.  How could that be a good investment?  I'm a university professor with 30 years experience, and I've seen all this many, many times.  Like the student whose parents forced him into law school and he became an alcoholic and dropped out after the first year.  (Which ended his alcoholism.)  The route to a rewarding and satisfying career is often not a straight or direct line.  I've seen that many times too.  People need to be given space and time to develop in accord with their actual natures and interests."

Shell corporations, like those set up by friend of a friend Irakly ""Ike"" Kaveladze, who was the eighth man at that infamous Trump Tower get together. 


Kaveladze was there to represent Russian real estate family the Agaralovs.

Sales of EVs jumped 91% in California during the first quarter. In part this reflected the availability of the new and popular Chevy Bolt. Sales of plug in hybrids were up 54% in the same period.

http://gas2.org/2017/05/20/california-ev-sales-91-first-quarter-2017/

California is important since what happens in California never stays in California. We will see an even bigger jump in EV sales when the Tesla Model 3 hits the highways later this year. EVs will not dominate any time soon but it certainly appears that they will make a more important contribution to total car sales every year."

On the other hand you want him to get the message actions have consequences.  I think he would have been a good candidate for caning in lieu of incarceration, in addition to the fines and the community service.  Given that caning may not go over with the American public, I felt the judge came close to the right balance. Except she might have directed he receive some psychiatric counseling.  I prefer caning to incarceration for certain criminals because it gets the person back into society quicker, it costs the state much less to administrate, and it makes an impression on the person."

Attitudes towards deficits, taxes, government spending, and role of government according to most polls have taken a sharp turn left and since Harper didn't adjust he lost.  Yes eventually the pendulum will swing back but that is probably a few elections away."

Build (at a huge loss) transmission lines for that power into Ontario - maybe we could use part or all of that power transmission line to nowhere that Ontario is still paying big bucks for, as a piece of the project Sure, it would cost a fortune to move, but what the hey?. At least it would be carrying electricity. 
Promptly sell the power back to Texas for pennies on the dollar, just to show them that Wynne's heart is in the right place. Why should only states bordering Ontario benefit from our power policies? What's a few billion $$ more or less?  
 Any Ontario residents wintering in Texas would, of course, pay Hydro 1 rates."

Your mention of the book, ""S.. D.. INVESTOR"" --- excellent book that should be in every investor's library. As you are well aware, though, it is not for everyone. It requires a certain logic that is in short supply in some people. 

I recall a few decades ago when I first heard of a stock by the name of ""Amalgamated Moose Pasture"". Being an outdoors sort of guy, I investigated it -- but not for long. Unlike some people we both know, I have sticky fingers and the money would not leave my wallet. 

Somewhere along the line, I came to realize that I was not a ""Player"" -- just an ""Investor"" -- and that has made all the difference. Throwing something up against a wall and hoping it sticks is a strategy that promises failure.

Now maybe they'll stop complaining and threatening to strike.

Wait, who am I kidding here.  Of course the WEA and the teachers aren't gonna stop complaining and threatening to strike.  Nothing is ever good enough for them...I guarantee this massive influx of spending (along with the associated massive increase in property taxes that we'll all have to endure) will be considered just the bare minimum by the WEA and the teachers and we'll have to continue to hear their interpretation of ""amply fund"" for years to come - none of which bodes well for the long suffering taxpayers' wallets or their sanity."

If a metaphor is what you need, it is the Parent, the big No.I who is running, and we the Christian voters are the Jesus who will or will not stand - with our brothers and sisters - for what is in the image and likeness of the Creator: civilization, civility, ethics, morality, decency and love, compassion. This core of civilization is integral to humanity, regardless of religious affiliation
The author pleads that we drop political affiliation, but retains religious affiliation exclusionism. From my limited reading, every book of the Koran begins with a call upon a compassionate God as is the call to Christians, Jews, etc. 
Regardless of how we abuse and disabuse our fundamental calling, we must continue to call in what we ALL share."

Steve, there are too few instances of police going out of their way to help others less fortunate then others. We have the pictures of people of color being tazed and shot, on account of their color.

I agree that there is a great deal of differences in students that attend Bellevue schools.  No two are identical after all. 

The point of my comment, for you and the other commentators, is that to only report on ethnicity and results carries the implication that only ethnicity matters.  A clearer statement that income matters a lot, a little , or not at all would have made this a complete article.  Even a reference to a study (from a wider community, if no study was available from BSD) about that correlation would have been an interesting addition to the article.

I'll hang on to my belief that family income matters a lot in educational outcomes, (without defining ""a lot""), until I see sufficient evidence is does not. I think there would likely be a wide variance in ""how much"", and ""why"" income matters."

783,"Dear Frank, I spoke with Dr. Fletcher today and found him to be extremely sincere and humble. The suggestions that you put forward are excellent and identify different methods that can be taken to mitigate the situation.  Each of us should learn from you as we learned from Dr. Fetcher. This is a human problem and the government(s) may not be nibble or desirous of making the required changes.  Dr. Fletcher and you ultimately come to the same conclusion; we must teach each other.  This is humanities problem that requires a people generated solution. The answers are elusive and a solution may even be unattainable but doing something is always better than remaining idle.  As you reported each individual must find his own way to address the effects of sudden and severe climate change.  Yours, is going vegan.  Totally commendable and definitely helpful to all of us.  Today, I add both you and Dr. Chip Fletcher to my list of the smartest people on the planet.  Aloha Frank..good job"
784,Why would an ATM swallow my card?
785,"I was so unbelievably angry about that sign, which I drive by every day both to work and on the way home. It was a great big F.U. to Anchorage that they erected it simply because they could. Pointless illegal and garish advertising for a location that needs no such advertising. They should have been ordered to remove it immediately. But at the time they pleaded ignorance and hoped that we'd get used to it. It remains the biggest sign in the least effective place in the city.

Diamond Parking is no friend of the City and they're showing it by how they simply don't care about our what they did in the first place, planning and zoning be damned. They certainly don't care now. The undue burden they complain about is one that they should have addressed before they violated the Code and erected it in the first place. They knew this day was coming. It needs to be taken down NOW. They siphon enough money from our economy as it is, they can't play the economy card here."

802,"See where some amongst the hockey intelligentsia who really should know better are on the Frederik Andersein for President bandwagon--just don't count that whiff in OT of game 1 that could end up costing Your Leafs the series.

Yeah, he's been pretty good, but he's not responsible for Your Leafs being ahead in the series.  If anything, it's his fault the team isn't up 3-0.

Back in the 2013 playoffs, a certain other Your Leafs goalie played likewise pretty good, .923 save % over a 7-gamer, flubbed a shot he shoulda had too, if memory serves.

Andersen's #s this season very very similar to what that other goalie posted.

Yet that other goalie, dirty rotten scoundrel, was made the scapegoat.

But he wasn't the golden boy, was he?  Nobody's was showering him with red rose petals like the newest guy, our guy."

813,"If your point is that what these people did was reprehensible, of course it was. But opposition to capital punishment isn't about warm fuzzy feelings for the guilty. It's about our commitment to the principle that God is the author of human life and only God has the right to take it. 

The death penalty is only justifiable if it is the only means by which to protect society from a dangerous person. Revenge isn't an acceptable reason for it and neither is revulsion at the crimes of the guilty."

879,"Personally, I think it's funny that our conservative state run by conservatives for decades, foundering because of their ""leadership"" and self-interest, recently voted for more of the same not just locally, but nationally. Anyone who voted the same conservatives into office here, and especially those who voted for Trump for president, has exactly zero right to talk or complain.  Cognitive dissonance much?"
880,play the last doctor who radio broadcast
881,"I agree with you and the NRA 100% on this. Hawaii already has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation. To buy a gun is a complex many-step process of taking a safety course. actually buying (but not receiving) the gun, going to the police department to get a permit (no, it doesn't include concealed carry), return to the gun store for the gun, return to the police department to register, and then finally the gun is yours to take home. Allowing the police the whim to take away that firearm is too vague, with no due process."
882,"And that has happened in New York state? Or maybe eliminating property taxes, income taxes and corporate taxes for ten years has generated a boom of business in the state? If the country did the same, only set as permanent policy, then we would see economic growth unlike this country has ever seen. These policies work and work well. Income disparity has grown much worse in the last 7 years due to democrat strangulation of business in this country. Also, unemployment among minorities, especially blacks and black teens has skyrocketed in the last 7 years. As many leaders in the minority community have pointed out, the democrats have done nothing to actually help them in any way. What do they say about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Mmmmmm."

894,"Not quite true. If half the benefit goes to the top 5% of income earners it doesn't necessarily mean the other 50% is evenly spread across the other 95%. It could be spread over the slightly lower 5% so, still not reach ""the middle class"".
""Scheme "" is not necessarily negative and accurately describes what an accountant/tax lawyer figures out for a specific case to save taxes. I don't understand your comment about ""the people in question already have a corporation set up, so what is the cost of income splitting?""The cost of income splitting falls on the rest of the public who either have to make up the shortfall in tax revenue or suffer a loss in services.

922,"Umm...yeah.

Definitely tops the legislative agenda and is no violation at all of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Last time I checked, we were still free to kite loonytunes theories about anything we pleased so long as they don't actually constitute hate speech. This would be in stark contrast to totalitarian regimes.

I'm kinda happy that I can say the PM is full of it instead of having to insist on his divine provenance, and happier still that if I want to wear a colander on my head and call it a religion I can do that, too.

941,"Todd, If Cedric is technically not a member of the party, yet both party Rules and State law require he be one in order to appear on the ballot as a Democrat, why would it be wrong that ""the idea of preventing Gates from being allowed to run was at least considered by him, the Party or both""? 

Should Tim NOT have ""considered"" taking some sort of action? Within the local Party, I have been one of the strongest advocates for leaving these sorts of decisions up to the voters rather than to party officers. Even when we are ""well-intended"" (which is not always the case), it gets very complicated to try to figure out the most just solution, especially when our Rules are kinda scrambled. I supported leaving Thielen's election to the Democratic voters of the Senate district rather than to party insiders, many of whom had obvious conflicts of interest. I pushed through the elimination of the six month membership requirement for candidates.

I think Tim is striking the right balance here."

The United States is being worked by folks that know once their ""family"" hits American shores they will receive everything for free.

I knew a guy who went completely bonkers almost as soon as he arrived in-country.  He couldn't handle that every ""gook"" he saw could be a Cong. He barricaded himself in an unused hootch.  Nobody knew if he had weapons in there.  It took about a dozen MPs using CS to get him out and onto a plane back home.

In any event, my point was that there isn't enough information available publicly to critique how Santiago was handled by the medical system in Anchorage."

Every person on that line was the same, same position, same hole, same wimpy result. Elway got suckered if he thought he was getting innovative coaches who were supposed to be aggressive in their style of play. They're team gets trounced for a half and they do nothing to change it during the halftime. They get a bye week to fix things that should have been fixed in the off-season and TC and all VJ can come up with is to tell us how much everyone enjoyed relaxing over the bye - including himself!

989,"No I have not idea what the actual facts of this case were. What I am able to do is to engage my own critical thinking skills and combine them with 2 individuals who were victims of Lane County Justice during the last few years. Both were overcharged with M11 crimes and both were effectively denied bail, both were jailed based upon he said she said evidence only for 3-6 months of their lives (one of them even passed a polygraph) and both were ultimately released after they agreed to plead guilty to guess what... coercion. 

When the DA offers up a 3 -6 mo time served sentence when the suspect was originally charged with M11 8 yrs + serve everyday charges then 1 of 2 things have happened: 1) they were overcharged to start with and 2) They likely didn't do it and opted to take the deal and the felony instead of rolling the big dice that could have effectively ended their lives. I don't live in Lane Cty but as an Oregonian I don't want people overcharged and guilty pleas extorted"

If you have suffered financial loss as a result of a crime, and it is simple to prove the amount of the loss, a criminal court may make a restitution order as part of a sentence. Restitution orders are NEVER made in respect of personal injury, whatever crime led to that injury."

1003,"Alternate care ? in hospital jargon, those under alternate care are called BEDBLOCKERS. maybe there aren't that many bedblockers who are carefully hidden from view anyway, visitors are rare in these back wards... !Citing bed-blockers is an excuse for a real shortage of beds.
There has been a population explosion in downtown Toronto, did hospital beds allocation grow at the same pace ? Of course not,we are fed meaningless stats, asked to participate in surveys to improve blah.blah blan.. while the shortage of beds grows.
Hospital staff is so frantic that they often ignore the most basic principles of care and compassion.
A few days ago I met the friend I was coming to visit in the ground floor lobby of the hospital, he had been discharged !!! I had visited the previous day ( gowned, masde, gloved and goggled ) there had been no indication of diagnosis or discharge ... When I asked patient relations why I had not been informed I was told "" They applied the law"""
1004,"21% is the figure for 2011, but raw log and lumber exports, primarily to China, increased from below 8 billion dollars in 2011 to over 9 billion in 2014.  This resulted in an increase in imports in those years, raising the price for everyone.  Only the bursting of the China construction bubble has lowered the cost of raw logs and finished products since 2015.

Computer controlled mills and mechanization of log harvesting have greatly reduced the number, and pay compensation, of jobs in logging and log milling.  Longshoreman jobs exporting Oregon logs to China don't come close to replacing all those lost jobs."

1011,"Of course the survey is saying people disapprove. It was taken after a whole lot of negative media reports. Before that people had no opinion on this issue. Public opinion has been formed by the negative news stories.

There are some good reasons for fund raising this way but they have not been discussed. One of them is that the politicians get off their duffs in Ottawa and meet people. Another is that ordinary Canadians can get to meet our leaders. The cost is not that onerous since the $1,500 price tag comes with a tax deduction.

If Trudeau ever comes to my neighbourhood I will scape up the $1,500 and go meet him in person. Or maybe meet the finance minister."

You need to apologize to the student body of  Punahou.  No, I attended Wai`anae and yes, we had to defend our student body from people like you hurling hurtful statements to the innocent."

This ""political activism"" sort of activity has crept insidiously into many spheres of life in the greater USA, and slowly, quietly, measures are passed and life becomes complicated, and more expensive. Unreasonable building codes, restrictions, and more. Governments profits from fees and become bloated, typically with an attitude which is unfriendly.
    There are nicely balanced responses here. The point brought forward is certain lobbyists need to be watched very closely. Strange stuff has been pushed quietly into law and regulation. Responsible recreational folks find themselves spending vast amounts of free time fighting often unreasonable restrictions, while other extremists of both ilk create hard feelings and can denigrate quality of life."

Some people that start life way below others do make it in life & don't become murderers, but I don't think this is the norm. I read about two boys that were black (which was already a strike against them) that were in prison.  Both their IQs were really low. Doesn't mean that their IQ was that low to begin with. There is something disturbing when you hear that one young man was passed around for sex to his buddies by his step-father. The other boy's mom sat him on a hot burner on the stove to punish him for being a bad boy. I guess this taught him to not behave! Yeah, right. It doesn't mean that they should go free, but I guess I can feel some compassion for people like this due to their circumstances. Also, statements like ""I was treated badly and I turned out okay.""

It is like us lecturing the world on carbon emission reductions when we have very close to the worst record in the developed world.   I'll say it again - all done for the cameras to influence the gullible.

The language for buyers & sellers does NOT have to be identical, AND they have different responsibilities.  Consumers must PAY the tax & RECEIVE a receipt while sellers are responsible only to COLLECT and REMIT the tax.

Sec 101(d) can be ENFORCED by STAA. They can require buyers to PROVE they PAID the tax & RECEIVED a receipt, but asking them to PRODUCE those receipts (and to conduct buyer audits - see my Pre-audit Questionnaire).

While some of today's S/L sales taxes may legally permit such audits, they are not conducted, for among other reasons, that they are a relatively small portion of States' revenues and relatively low tax rates. BUT FAIRtax would be about 80% of all fed taxes and its added 30% rate (total combined rates 30-45%) would generate ENORMOUS evasion. THAT's why BUYERS MUST BE AUDITED."

It would seem to me 7 days a week would not be enough time for a PM to get all his work properly done. So my question is this, ""Is the PM just the poster boy for this government?""

1267,"Sounds like Hydro costs are a bigger problem for small businesses, I wonder if any of them have taken advantage of the subsidies and switched to energy efficient devices. Many small businesses are inefficient in many ways but like to blame labour laws and workers for their hardships. The truth in many cases is they underreport incomes and find ways to rip off their underpaid employees. With burgers in Toronto al $15 dollars+ in a restaurant and everything else even higher it's hard to believe that a full restaurant is not making money, unless of course it's being mismanaged or they are underrepresenting income. I would imagine rents are probably the biggest costs anyways. The libertarians on here would say boo hoo to the restauranteurs if they complained about high rents over high wages."

The stuff that trump publicly says has about the same connection to his actual intentions as much as that guy.. while Russia wants to be the biggest and essentially only supplier of energy to Europe, Trump's team is making plans to keep Assad in power so through him Putin's buddies can control where the output of the pipelines through Syria go.

1286,"You know you are far left when someone doesn't pay taxes on a very small portion of their income and you consider that a subsidy. Since virtually everyone can pay for some medical/insurance costs on a pre-tax basis, you are too far off the mark with your subsidy comment. 

Now, I can show you real subsidies that pay out more the less you make. Actual money coming your way to pay for health insurance. 

If the HSA subsidy bothers you, why don't we re-write our tax laws completely? Flat tax, everyone pays a portion in for roads and defense, etc. No shelters, no EIC, no subsidies. That would be far more fair, don't you think?"

No matter if they have a D, R, or I after their name, throw them OUT. The people involved with this larcenous act need to be prosecuted and jailed. Mark Pfeffer and Bob Acree should be charged under federal racketeering laws and sued down to their socks. Hawker and company should be similarly stripped of every dime and jailed.

1295,"The GM just recently had an analysis from Stats Can showing where the big salaries are in Canada, and not surprisingly it is in the oil and gas sector in the west. When our economy started to rebound earlier this year , it was due in large part to the resource sector. The huge transfer payments that Quebec gets some where past $11B, comes the oil and gas rich west, which explains their current anger.  We have resources which have allowed us to be the envy of countries around the world, and our strategy is to put as many obstacles in the way as possible to extract these resources. Perhaps oil is on the way out and new technologies will replace it, then all the more reason to make the money while you can. If you were holding a stock that if sold now would generate substantial profit, and you knew that eventually it would be worth little, why would you then hang on to that stock. That seems to be the current position, oil is going to replaced so lets leave the money in the ground."

In the Divine Office when asking the Hebdomadarian for a blessing the formula is, 'Jube, Domne, benedicere,"" (Pray Sir, a blessing), not Pater (Father). 'Domne' being a contraction of 'Domine' (Lord) to distinguish it from Our Lord. Some monks and Canons Regular are addressed as Dom and some abbesses and nuns as Dame. Italian priests are often addressed as 'Don'.
As the Religious Orders were suppressed at the Reformation all the clergy left were secular and continued to bear the title Rev Mr to this day.
French priests are often addressed as M'sieur l'Abbé which derives from the Hebrew or Aramaic for 'father'. 
I also understand that deacons in the Eastern Churches are also addressed as Father; in the West it is 'Deacon' or Rev Mr."

1420,"Thank you very much for giving those of us who are not Liberal shills in Ottawa permission to read the omnibus budget bill.

I am surprised that you have deigned to do so in our rapidly evolving transition to a `guided democracy`.

On the negative side, I notice that you are all over this thread and have posted over a dozen specious and transparently misleading defences of this, Justin`s latest bimbo eruption.

I also notice that my single detailed expose post in this thread has gathered so much support that it has `mysteriously` vanished from this thread.

So have other popular posts critical of the Liberals.

Are you being paid by the Liberals for your non-stop posting here?

Are you a moderator here as well or just connected with one or more of the moderators?

In any event, the censorship here is disgracefully partisan for the Liberals in Ottawa and your part in it is reprehensible.

1434,"Opinions cannot be debunked.  For example, if the state department does not have documentation as to where $6 billion went, in my opinion they lost it.  Government is all about documentation.  If there is no documentation as to where the money went in detail, then Trump was correct is criticizing the operation and it is reasonable to say the money was lost if records regarding its disposition where lost.

Trump's comment on Putin is correct in my opinion.  The two men have probably shared at most a few words in formal situations.  I think it is likely that Trump does not know Putin in any personal sense.  This is my opinion and past Trump comments regarding Putin's public face do not mean to me that Trump knows him.

The undocumented labor claim actually pisses me off.  Trump is a developer not a contractor.  He hired a contractor who may or may not have used undocumented workers.  But bottom line, the developer does not micromanage a contractor.

RC intends to end NAFTA one way or another. Why give him an easy victory? Make him fight for it. 

If we do not walk away he cannot claim that negotiations have failed, only that they will take a lot longer than expected. There are a lot of legislators who do not want to lose NAFTA, particularly because of the actions of an idiot. RC needs a win. He wins if we walk.

DO NOT GIVE IT TO HIM!!!!!!!!

He allows himself to be caught after sending films of him planting 3 of the nuclear bombs. The CIA interrogator only finds out where the 3 bombs are after torture and shooting the terrorist's wife  in front of him.   The CIA interrogator realizes by the amount of plutonium in each of the three bombs that there must be a fourth nuclear bomb somewhere in an American city.

1533,"Although I heartily agree with the article, it is a game of chicken that a city can lose. The NBA chose to make an example of Seattle when it refused to provide a new venue for the Sonics (now the OKC Thunder). Seattle taxpayers had just 10 years earlier, paid for a major renovation of the existing facility. When the renovation was finished, and the doors re-opened, the NBA heralded the new space as ""state of the art"" and ""what all basketball venues should aspire to"", and yet one short decade later, it was ""obsolete"" and ""unable to provide the necessary revenue possibilities necessary to sustain an NBA franchise"". The team was purchased by out of town owners and moved within a couple of years. Since, it has been a very convenient and lucrative gambit to use the vacancy in Seattle as leverage for the NBA to induce reluctant NBA cities to pony up tax dollars for new venues or ""well, Seattle is looking for a franchise"". Calgary would likely play that role in the NHL."

1549,"I have never understood why abandoning your history, and in this case the monarchy, is a good thing and would solve our problems or even a single problem.

We have built a great country and if you cannot see that Elizabeth I suggest you get out more with average Canadians and abandon the presumably intellectual circuit you are part of?

Yes we have made mistakes as a country, just as people do and I know I have and I am betting you have (if you were honest), but if you simply dwell on the bad stuff you will make yourself crazy and is what I see in some as the ""Would of, Could of, Should of Syndrome""

Try to be more optimistic and enjoy the country so many died to protect!"

Meanwhile, the softball team -- which actually makes the postseason each spring instead of just talking about it -- played eight exhibition games in October and will embark on a two-week, eight-game tour of New Zealand next month.
The softball team that drew twice as many fans per game (2,093) last year as baseball did (1,045) gets ignored. Why is that?"

It's also important to remember that that project also involved a nonsensical route connecting luxury shopping center.  Back then it was from Aloha Tower and ending at Kahala Mall and the big talk today would be how best to tear it down."

Of course, Catholics stopped having 5 and 6 kids, just as second-generation immigrants have family sizes the same as their native peers (if only because it's too expensive to have big families). 

The Catholic takeover of Canada (and the U.S.) was a bogeyman that terrified nativists. It proved to be unfounded alarmism. So will the Muslim takeover of Canada."

1677,"First, it is illegal for a private clinic to charge the public system for a service if they also charge the patient for the same service.  Either you are all in or all out on a given case. The public reimbursement doesn't cover the cost of running a private surgical clinic - this is normal because if a patient is operated on in a public hospital, the hospital receives lump sum funding to cover this so the surgeon isn't assuming these costs, so they shouldn't get extra for costs not assumed.

I hate the ""jumping the line"" statement.  The government is deliberately limiting the amount of OR time so surgeons cannot handle the patient caseloads.  From a professional point of view, can you imagine how unsatisfying it is to have a 2 year wait list of patients you cannot help because of bureaucratic nonsense?  Surgeons are trying to find a workaround for this and governments are letting them because they don't want to pay for what is needed.  That's why the clinics aren't being shut down."

However, even if they do take steps to impeach. I believe Trump would never let that happen, he's a coward, so he'd resign, try to make some sort of deal to escape criminal prosecution, and then make up more stories about how he's a great guy who has been victimized."
1703,"No, I drove past it during construction almost everyday. It's real brick. The construction appeared to be high quality. My problem is the unimaginative design. With the size of the architecture department and all the architects in this town, it's rather amazing how poor the buildings are in this little city. Almost all newer ones are formulaic and, in a word, boring.
Like it or not, Thom Mayne's ""new"" federal courthouse is a breath of fresh air. As the surrounding landscape grows up around it, it will soften. I'm mystified by those who call it a glass building, It has a lot of it, of course, as do all modern buildings. But it's far from the Jaqua center or the proposed Eugene City Hall..."

1713,"Larry,

While that confrontation in Congress was the first real opposition to Sen. Joe McCarthy, what he never recovered from was an expose done by CBS News correspondent Edward R. Murrow, who revealed to America the lies his zealotry had driven him to create and believe. In his commentary about McCarthy, Murrow observed that Communism was ""the great evil of our time"" and that it was based on a web of lies. Then he pointed to the scriptural principle of becoming like what we behold and concluded that, by paying such attention to evil and the lies used to promote it, the Senator had become like it while trying to uproot it from America.  

Some say McCarthy's early death was hastened by his public shaming and personal disappointment. Christians can take a lesson from him: by trying to uproot what we think are evils in the church we are in danger of becoming just as evil because our focus is on it instead of Christ."

Then I posted parts of it on line in 2009. Here is a subtitle, ""AM I AT ABU GHRAIB? No, they have decent health care there."" I had to write the thing twice because I had a mysterious hard drive failure after the first one. That letter was about injustice, an incompetent, dysfunctional bush hospital, some other crazy things, what I experienced and observed in the prison system when they had me wrongfully arrested on a false charge to try and use that as leverage to get me to drop an appeal and shut me up. Does it seem like it worked? Instead as a retired RN who had several specialties but the relevant ones here are critical care, ER and psych, some prison infirmaries and prior to being an RN worked with mentally ill legal offenders, so I began a campaign of trying to get something done about what went on.

1769,"Cutting taxes and certain programs at the federal level does not preclude them being assumed at the state level. As the U.S. is a federation of states, more of these programs could be handled by the individual states themselves. Under the 10th amendment, the states retain the right to provide for public health and safety of which environmental protection and health care fall. Of course that would just mean a lowering of federal taxes and a raise of state taxes. There is also something to be said about greater efficiency and economies of scale of having some of these services provided by the federal government and Americans have seen the ineffectiveness of some states in handling their health infrastructure like water (e.g. Michigan). It would however allow Trump to be able to say he fulfilled his election promise of lowering taxes by downloading more services on to the states. Many American's don't approve of a large federal government anyway."

1781,Foolish reply. Trump deliberately avoided endorsing Article 5 in order to bring about the response which he has now seen - from Germany and now from Canada. If you really think the Americans are simply going to retreat from the world stage and never be heard from again you are deluded. Trump has the G7 leaders right where he wants them.

1788,"Religious liberty was NOT at stake. Religious liberty was a timely excuse to thrust a dagger in a strategy of killing Obamacare by a thousand cuts. The foundation of the case was not religious liberty but a corporation's legal status as a person. Hobby Lobby is a terrible decision, introducing arbitrariness and imponderables into the system and ripe for abuse.

Little Sisters is simply the non-profit version of the challenge, though the case ultimately concerned the Sisters' rejection of the government's accommodation based on the Catholic Church's degrees of mediate material cooperation. (One wonders if the church has ever before in the history of the US brought such refined scruple to bear on public policy.)

1803,"We call ourselves ""Deplorables"" because Hillary Clinton proudly gave Trump supporters that moniker. The Trump administration has earned an A+ since the inauguration, though nothing they or their supporters have done is the act of a cretin, nor vandalism, nor is it based in some erroneous claim of  ""xenophobic nationalism. Heck, just this week, for example, Trump is trying to drag America back to the brutal primitivity of the mid 2010s when men couldn't use the same bathrooms as women! Oh, and sorry if my attempt at using correct grammar comes across as racist (seeing as the The Writing Center at the University of Washington is telling students that expecting Americans to use proper grammar perpetuates racism). You can find that article which is titled ""University of Washington Declares Proper Grammar Is Racist"" at Brietbart, by the way. You'll never see such a thing at the leftist WNT!"

1853,"Maybe the driver did see them and felt it was safe to pass, we don't know.  It seems the letter was written with too much emotion and too little factual clarity.  If there wasn't a shoulder beyond the fog line, it seems like a dangerous stretch to ride at 15mph, in a 55. 

Of all the other roads to ride on, why pick such a dangerous section?  (Reminds me of the thoughtless riders drafting wheel-to-wheel on a shoulder-less section of Territorial.)  Don't riders understand how vulneable they make themselves, right or wrong?"

1865,"More looney tune banter from the party of hate.  What exactly did OUR president and Mr. Kushner do that is illegal?

Tell you what, let's just have the IRS look into your taxes because I am sure you did something illegal that would constitute tax fraud.  How does it feel to be accused with no evidence or reasoning to support the allegation?  Oh wait, the libtards don't pay taxes, they sponge off us hard working tax payers."
1866,Tell me how many transactions I can do with a disposable card.
1867,"Your way to out of touch,  If I was to but insurance on the market place it would be $52485 a YEAR for the gold with a 10000 out of pocket max...  there is nothing affordable about this so called ACA unless you don't work........"
1868,"So Trump and Cruz are capitalizing on fear. I'm sure Obama, Clinton, and Sanders have never done that.

What is Patty doing when she says that Trump “raves like a wild drunk …” and compares his rants to those of Hitler? Is she perhaps capitalizing on our fear of encountering wild drunks and our fear of genocide?

With more than a month until our primarly and then several months to the general election, dozens of letters and online comments have equated Trump to Hitler. Certainly dozens more are still to come. I would suggest that the first measure of a lack of intelligence is to fall back on that tired comparison to try to discredit Trump. There are certainly other evidence-backed ways to try to discredit him and his record, but the feeble-minded just want to scream Hitler."

1872,We think were lessors. Since we signed the lease. All negotiations were done with signing.
1873,"Didn't really look for it.  Like I said, my point isn't that the law is unconstitutional, but rather that arguing that voluntarily compliance trumps constitutionality is flawed.

Regardless, the case isn't really dispositive.  It lays a good foundation for the argument in support of the constitutionality, but it's focused on the actions of a political party in selecting candidates in a primary.  The lack of state action is critical to its decision.  There's a pretty fundamental difference between a political party saying ""we won't put you on the ballot unless you promise to vote a certain way"" and a state government saying ""we're going to engage in criminal prosecution if you don't vote a certain way."""

Please no negative remarks here......in addition reports coming out he was possibly showboating...diving and dipsydoodling around....not smart under any circumstances.

1887,"John Adams was a complete heretic by Catholic standards. A Congregationalist by birth, he would eventually abandon belief in the Trinity and the divinity of Christ. Though a ""church-going animal"" Adams famously exclaimed in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:

""Twenty times, in the course of my late Reading, have I been upon the point of breaking out, ’This would be the best of all possible Worlds, if there were no Religion in it.'""

He would later backtrack that “without Religion this World would be Something not fit to be mentioned in polite Company, I mean Hell.""

1915,"Except that high income earners in Canada *DO* pay taxes, a LOT of taxes.

In fact the top 10% of earners in this country pay more than half of all income taxes that are paid, an amount vastly in excess of their proportion of income.  They not only are paying ""their fair share"", they are also paying the ""fair share"" for everyone else.  The way our tax system is setup losing only a very small proportion of high income earners in Canada would result in the complete collapse of our social programs because they are covering the lions share of the cost.

On a per capita basis an individual needs to earn somewhere $90,000/year just to break even on the taxes they pay vs. the per capita cost of government services."
1916,"The house was never worth 4.2 or 3.6. 

someone only wanted to buy the opportunity to make 20% gains on 4.2 and hand the bag over to the next investor within 6-12 months of deferring mortgage payments while claiming 'primary residence' without ever stepping foot into the country."

1923,I've tried looking for the auto-top up option on your website and I can't seem to find it. Can you help me?
1924,"Wow, to loosen laws around electoral processes is just gross irresponsibility.

Not to fear, this hyper-partisan and ideological government has set the tone for future governments.  Just change whatever you don't like immediately after taking office, based on principle alone.  

In 3 years, the conservatives will just reverse Justins reversal.  It's the liberal way of governance.

BTW, when Justin is deporting up to 60 Canadians a month for false information on citizenship applications, why is Monsef still in Canada? Why do liberals want a 2 tiered system of laws, where the rule of law only applies to other people?

All of this just confirms the underlying notion that liberals really prefer a fascist system of governance when they re in power."
1925,POTUS remaining neutral and calm is a signal that all will be well. Nothing to see here folks.
1926,"And what about Bill Clinton, the former president who lied about his sexual abuse of women that he had power over for years and years ?
Lied to his wife and daughter ? That Bill Clinton ?
Bill Clinton who so many look up to, to this day for his ""leadership"" ?
Bill Clinton, the man who looked us in the eyes and lied through his teeth in front of millions of Americans on television about NOT having sex with ""that woman"" ? 
Bill Clinton who was impeached by the House for his lies ? 
Lies under oath ?
Bill Clinton who was identified by one of the underage girls as being present when his good friend Epstein and friends had sex with her and other underage girls ? 
Bill Clinton who never banned or spoke out against Epstein ? 
Wonder why ? Was he afraid of what Epstein had on him ?
Bill Clinton and Epstein are two peas in a pod !
Or, better yet, partners in crime !
How about Bill's wife who ""forgave"" him but did everything she could to destroy the women who dared to speak out ?"

1935,"Mancini: ""It is a document that places the protection of  young people as an essential responsibility of the bishops as leaders of the gospel and the church"".

Well seeing will be believing. I just wonder how they are going to get around the Pontifical Secret & Canon Law issues. It is a familiar episcopal statement of intent, that has been articulated many many times. I wonder why I am sceptical. They appear to be updating their drafts to be in line with the Vatican. That does not give room for much optimism."
1936,Where is the cash from my cheque I recently deposited?
1937,"""Tougher election law needed to guard against foreign influence: senators""

And also inappropriate third parties.

However, regardless of any tougher election law, we all know that someone, somewhere will find a way to get around the new law."
1938,This is shameful. It is not an investment it is just another bleeding of the taxpayer to benefit the heavily subsidized dairy industry. This has to stop Mr Trudeau. Consumers and taxpayers have been taken advantage of for too long to subsidize this industry. Why isn't every other sector impacted by CETA been invested in?
1939,"The reality is that we tend to hire people of our race. For example, I knew of a manufacturing company that was started by an Iranian immigrant. Almost all his office staff and managers that he dealt with directly were Iranians. The people are on the factory floor were all immigrants from every country like China and the Philippines.

I knew an IT company that was looking for JAVA programmers. The team leader quietly admitted that he was going to toss aside resumes from Chinese and Indian immigrants since he didn't feel comfortable with them.

As a contractor, I worked in the headquarters of a giant multi-national food processing company. Almost all of the 300 office workers were Caucasians from Toronto's suburbs. I counted only around 5 black people in the company. I estimate that there were only around 30 Asians in the company."

He also volunteers for many local non profits.  Bill Miller
1944,"Since when did fair taxes equate to class warfare. The ""average"" Canadian family is hard pressed to take advantage of existing tax shelters - RRSP, TFSA, RESP etc. But wait, wealthy people want more. Sprinkling dividends/salaries from a corporation is pure tax avoidance. This problem is aggravated by the underground economy, which is huge but seldom discussed. Canadians expect a lot from our governments. Healthcare, infrastructure, security, social services etc. These bills have to be paid is we are not goiung to bankrupt our children. (retired MD)."

1951,"Given that the story of Adam and Eve is mythology and that, while there obviously had to be ""first"" man and a ""first"" woman, it does not follow that both evolved at the same time and the same place nor that they are humanity's ""first"" parents.  The theology of Original Sin is without foundation, ergo, so too is the Immaculate Conception.  If we accept that God is both creator and ultimate author of Scripture, then our theology must never fail to respect the authority of both science and scripture/tradition if it is to be viable.
Furthermore, how valid is it to suggest that anyone can be guilty because of another's sin.  Yes, I can cause another to sin, but I will never believe my personal guilt can be passed on to another."

All I use is a simple (all be it  aggressive) couch potato portfolio using TD Index E Funds.  Super simple, rebalance  when I make my annual contribution and forget it.

1978,"Make a carbon tax genuinely revenue neutral, unlike the carbon taxes being instituted by our governments, with carbon taxes offset by corresponding decreases to income and corporate taxes.   That's what economists who originally proposed carbon taxes had in mind and that way we won't undermine Canadian competitiveness and prosperity. Otherwise we'll have our own Trump a few years down the road. Jeffrey Simpson used to make basically the same point when he was writing for the Globe."

1988,"I haven't found the one I spoke of, but still looking. However, I did come across this one:
Thomas McGuire1 day ago
In August of 1969 I was hitchhiking in the rain by Paxson. A Land Rover appeared and picked me up. The driver was a girl named Pixie Loomis who was a student at Wellesley college. She had driven to Alaska with two college friends plus a young man named Mike from Boston College. Pixie said that her two friends were working at a cannery in Valdex while she was heading to a job in Fairbanks. She mentioned that one of her friends had just given the commencement address at Wellesley I rode with Pixie all the way to Fairbanks where I found also found work. I visited Pixie before she left and very briefly met her friends. One was Hillary Rodham, headed for Yale and beyond. I stayed in Alaska, live now on the banks of the Chilkoot River and would not trade places with Hillary for all of Donald Trump's money. I will be voting for her next month and not because I briefly met her."

1999,"==================
  "" .  .  .after a string of verdicts that seem to tell women there's just no point complaining about sexual assault – the Jian Ghomeshi case in Canada; the Bill Cosby mistrial in the United States – a jury chose to believe Swift over Mueller. ""
==================================
Odd comment. Kate Taylor only seems to respect judicial process when it delivers the result she has prejudged on the basis of her ideology.
(PS:  I'm of the opinion that in the most recent case Swift was very very likely telling the truth.)"
2000,"While what you say is obvious, it is also true that for whatever reason many women don't accept that responsibility or don't have the discipline to take a pill every day or won't stop in the heat of the moment to take care of contraception. I don't know why.  But it is true.

So, if we want to deal with reality and reduce abortions, then the $19 dollar a month pills or relying on the condom that doesn't get used - are not the entire answer. Some studies have shown that long-acting contraceptives, such as iud or implant forms of contraceptive are more effective in reducing unplanned pregnancies. In my own case, my own contraceptives in my younger years were much more expensive because I medically couldn't take the cheapies.

I don't understand why some folks don't act responsibly.  But some don't. So, if reducing abortions is so terrible important, then we have to be willing to look for effective solutions. Or, forget trying to stop abortions.

And, educate our young to be responsible."

2021,"""Nothing can perfect unity in the church but the spirit of Christlike forbearance."" ""She scores a perfect 10."" ""Persons representing all viewpoints...., need to prayerfully and carefully consider her wise and inspired counsel....""

Perfect unity in the Church is when every soul is led by the Spirit of Christ; letting Him speak His words and not their own; thinking His thoughts and not their own. But this does not happen, because people love to hear and do as other humans teach--""because they have itching ears""; and by this silence the Voice of Christ within them, if in fact He even is IN them?

Conclusion: Who said this: ""You worship what you do not know.""? We should ""carefully consider [HIS] wise"" counsels, because HE lives--but she does not!"

While UNLV, Fresno and Utah st. seemed winnable at the beginning of the year, they have all made improvements, while defensively UH is getting poorer by the minute.  Until Rolo gets help for the D-coordinator it's going to be a long rest of the season."
2055,Some good points. But the harm was to unsuspecting new shareholders who bought without benefit of the bad news. The initial harm was the fraud. Nothing could be done about that after the fact. The harm the executives apparently directly caused was when shares traded at a price that did not reflect material bad news. The existing share owners should not have been protected and given the chance to sell to unsuspecting new owners.

2068,"Benny? Comparable case? No.

First terms. Natural rights are rights with which we are endowed simply by being. Canon Law is positive law, laws which are made by legislation. Different things.

Second, process. In 2006 Morris released a pastoral letter that called for discussion of the ordination of married men and the ordination of women and also suggested that the Catholic Church consider recognising ""Anglican, Lutheran, and Uniting Church orders"".

Vatican officials then attempted to reconcile Morris with the Church's teachings.

On May 1, the Apostolic Nuncio announced that the Pope had ""removed [Morris] from pastoral care"" of his diocese.

On May 13, 2011, the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference (ACBC) issued a statement, stating that they supported Pope Benedict’s decision to remove Morris due to “problems of doctrine and discipline”.

The Holy Father gave Bishop Morris five years to conform. There was zero question Bishop Morris was in conflict with the Church."
2069,"It's the same level of moral acrobatics performed by conservatives who rail against a choice a woman makes regarding continuation of a pregnancy yet support a wholly immoral and unthinkable Federal budget proposal such as the one in the works now.

2157,"… Stray cats have been listed as “vermin” since the early 1900’s. This is why it is even legal to use any and all vermin-poisons on them. For an even more species-specific vermin poison check into the toxicity of “Lilium” species of flowers too. Be certain the plant contains the word “Lilium” in the scientific-name (other plants with the word “Lily” in the common-name may be toxic to other species besides cats). Common N. American “Day Lilies” (Hemerocallis graminea) also work, they are the one exception to the rule that the name “Lilium” needs to be in the scientific name. Lilium species of flowers are 100% fatal to cats ONLY, even a bit of pollen on their fur that they lick-off will do. If they even drink a bit of water in which a bunch of Lilium flowers have been kept – that too is fatal, but totally harmless to all other species of animals (including dogs).

2197,"This topic is right on and deserves a good deal of thought.  The country runs a deficit year in and year out.  Things will not change.  thus there should be more thought given to who buys the debt, which Trump has suggested he will devalue.  His business record has certainly used bankruptcy, plainly there will be interest in just who buys the debt and how much interest they will demand."
2198,"I'm sure that not showing up for work without a valid reason will catapult your career ahead.

For a couple years I worked with a female engineer, a very rare breed. She'd work 2 months, take a week off, work another couple months, take two weeks off. In her first year she took 6 weeks off when she was entitled to three (not sure how management allowed this). 

Then she got pregnant, left for a year, came back for 8 months, got pregnant and left for a year, returned for 6 months and quit to become a stay at home mom.

She had a degree and an opportunity in a male dominated field but had zero interest in working. She used the job to qualify for EI and make some spare cash between vacations and then left the workforce for good.

2209,"You're right. I should have worded it as ""communist"" instead of democrat.  Anybody that supports a party that throws an ambassador under the bus along with the Americans that died attempting to get him out of danger, thinks that illegal aliens are ""undocumented immigrants"" and have broken no laws; really should re-examine why they live in the U.S. instead of packing up and moving to Venezuela."
2210,what's the weather for my location this week
2211,"Canada produces approx. 1.6% of the world's GHG emissions. If we theoretically reduce that to 0% (not possible in the foreseeable future), it will not slow or stop global warming.
Taxes will not slow or stop global warming. That will simply penalize the businesses that now rely on oil in gas to produce products, with no viable alternative.
Add in another 1 billion or more increase in the world's population in the next 100 years, and GHG emissions will continue to increase globally.
Oil will be used for decades, possible centuries to come. Coal was the primary source of energy for centuries and it took 100 years to make the switch to oil and gas. That is the timeline we need to embrace for a switch to a carbon intensive economy to some sort of alternative energy source not yet invented - solar, nuclear, wind do not power transport trucks, ships, trains, planes, nor do they provide a substitute for the approx. 7000 products oil is used in.

If wages are paid above what a position delivers in profit to a business, the business will eventually fail. Your pay is based on what benefit you deliver. Your pay is not based on what you think you're worth."

2317,"Reading this article and the comments section, it would be difficult to see that: 1. small business owners get significant tax breaks and 2. these tax breaks had a rationale - namely support jobs and offset risk. The government is saying that policy rationale is not working in  some instances and they are looking to claw it back where it is not. 3. Tax breaks for some means the rest of us have to pay higher taxes to cover health care, defence, education, roads and all that. I don't mind that but it better be in support of policies that are working. If the policy isn't working then they should phase it out over a reasonable time period - say 5 years. Harper, by the way, got rid of plenty of corporate tax breaks during his time in office."

2324,"While I have a lot of respect for Bernie, and will vote for him, for a long time I have wished for a national referendum on changing the American voting process. I suspect I would be happier in the system used in Great Britain. Well, without the royalty nonsense. I wish third party candidates could run and simply designate that their votes could go to someone else if not successful. Thus, Bernie could have run as an Independent, and if he didn't win nationally, his votes could have gone to the Democrats.

I usually don't blame the candidates though. The system forces them to grab for tons of cash by not saying some things and pandering around saying things they may not really believe. Not many people would go through the national election process. Look at the intense scrutiny that they have to endure, and look at the danger that they have to face every day. They are brave to run. The fault truly lies in the system, not the candidates. As a country we are them.

2353,"Good point. 
Perhaps Trudeau could define ""Islamophobia"". The history of the term ""Islamophobia"" is not a secret, it was made popular by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1990's - they engaged in a successful campaign to label any criticism (or satire) of Islam as religious discrimination (the Muslim Brotherhood is a political movement who's ultimate goal is society governed by Islamic law). The term found sympathy among the western campus left and self-titled social justice warriors in an ironic case of useful ignorance (given the sad state of civil society and lack of individual rights in countries governed by Islamism). The fact that women are forced to submit to male authority under the guise of religious piety and the fact that LGBTQ rights are non-existent seems to be lost among so-called ""progressives"". But we can't talk about individual freedoms in countries governed by Islamic law, #becauseit's2017

What works best for me is to do everything I can the night before (lay out clothes, pack my lunch, prep and set my coffee maker to get started at its pre-programmed time, prep my work bag...my keys, wallet, etc. are always in the same place in the morning, so they can easily be scooped up), no matter how tired I am, so that I have the minimum to do when I arise, for whenever I slack on something I could have done the night before, doing that extra thing(s) in the morning always hits a snag.

In the industrial complexes on the Cape Flats the pressure was gone months ago.  Water pressure was 0.7 bar : not enough to rinse urinals.   Not a big deal, but also not enough pressure to charge up the fire sprinkler system...

Responsible businesses have put up very big water tanks as buffer and their own surface pumps to charge the fire system.   At my place we have 500,000 liter buffer capacity in case municipal supply cannot keep up with fire fighting.   Ironically we are located on the Berg River which is now not even a stream because all our catchment is going to Cape Town.

When people die in fires or lots of property is destroyed,  Cape Town will be at the receiving end of some big law suits for its gross incompetence."

2368,"Hardly a pastoral approach, that, but all things being equal, I don's see that much of a point is being made here.  It seems more an attempt to buttress opinion with questionable cites (I hardly think USA Today's pop psychology is science) and air personal grievances under the guise of a legitimate discussion of religious beliefs.  Perhaps it would benefit all to resist the urge to accuse others of being trolls, and avoid labels like ""bullying.""  I understand you are only trying to be humorous, and accountants do seem to have a hard time with humor, don't they, but perhaps it is time to move on?  Not all here will appreciate your wit with the same relish as I.  *lol*"

The Bakery was found to have discriminated in violation of Statutes regarding protected class status and refusal of accomodations/services.  The case will likely go clear to the Supreme Court regarding the Bakers' contention that their First Amendment Rights include the right to refuse service to a gay couple, based on their religious beliefs trumping the anti-discrimination law.  

I have absolutely no knowledge of what kind of Christian your Grandmother was.  However, I do criticize Christians who use their religion as a tool to justify discriminating against LGBT individuals.  I feel we should allow others to live their own lives w/o our interference so long as they aren't hurting anyone else.  IMO, individuals in consensual gay relationships are hurting no one.  Indeed, I will continue to criticize discrimination against such couples.  I make no apologies for that.  Gary Crum"

If Labour had Owen Smith or Sadiq Khan as opposed to Corbyn they would be on their way to winning instead of tied or just slightly ahead in the polls.  Corbyn is very popular amongst millennials who weren't around during the 70s and 80s, but scares the heck out of most over 55 including even many traditional Labour voters in that age group."

I was stationed in the south, and that flag waves under people of all races raised in the south. It is a representation of their right to rebel. 

If you want to talk hypocrites of race inferiority, look no further than the democratic party that fought against the movement to free the slaves. The same party that to this day, works tirelessly to keep low-income earners stuck in deadend government programs. 

Anyone who says the confederate flag ""scares"" them, is nothing but a squeaky wheel looking for people to hear them whine to become the center of attention. The only way that flag should ""hurt"" someone, is someone rolled it up...froze it and hit someone with it.

Literally, this election cycle is their Waterloo, as they now have a candidate that espouses their views and down-ticket candidates that are all on the same page - and they are all going to war with the liberals and moderates. What the Tea Party is about to find out is, upon the defeat of Trump, Ms. Stenger and others who espouse a racist, sexist, bigoted philosophy is that it will be an absolute defeat. That will, in turn, give more moderate voices in the Republican Party enough power to truly oust the Tea Party/Freedom Caucus/Sean Hannity/Breitbart pols from the mainstream and relegate their entire movement to the trash heap of political history."

2512,"So what does the ""U"" on the identity document stand for?  Unknown?  Undefined?  Perhaps it stand for ""Unicorn.""  

Honestly, this is not progressive; its moving backwards.  People treat girls and boys differently because they ARE different, not because they're trying to impose gender stereotypes onto them.  The only reason we can speak of a non-binary gender identity at all is because there already are well-established social and behavioural differences, i.e ""stereotypes"" between males and females.  

This child will discover which camp it falls into soon enough.  Ongoing parental efforts to convince the child that it is ""neither"" male or female, or ""both"" male and female, will negatively impact their child's emerging sense of identity, and lead to emotional issues down the road."
2513,"Let's be honest here. Look around today. Canada does not have a culture of entrepreneurship. We are more concern about gender pronouns, coddling illegals crossing our border, giving first nations unfettered access to cash without accountability, and other all sorts of nonsense.

Just as we are witnessing the severe flaws in the existing governance system in the US, we are now starting to see these flaws appearing here.

Our politicians and cabinet ministers are not held to an annual performance review that other more administratively progressive governments are now doing. In Rwanda, government ministers are now held to annual strict performance reviews. They imported this system from Singapore. Being elected is just the opportunity. You have to work at it to stay in your job."

2543,"Mr. Moisi, someone probably did not warn you. But by offering your insights on the current political climate in Europe you have stepped through Lewis Carroll's Looking Glass into an alternative reality.
In this universe, the fact that you studied at the Sorbonne and Harvard.; that you are a senior adviser at the Institut Montaigne in Paris, a visiting professor at Harvard and the chairholder for Geopolitics at the College of Europe, the oldest educational institution in European affairs, and have  studied these issues all your life-- all this means nothing. In fact, it is a back mark against your, Sir.
In the universe of G&M comments, reason, logic, knowledge, fact, discussion is set aside in favour of vituperation, simplification, name calling.
Nuuance or historical knowledge is especially verbotten and ridiculed.
One-liners, trash talk and the default cry of ""fake news"" are the coin of this realm.
So, apologies Sir, but you must  taken have taken a wrong turn."

For the cost and wasted money and lost business growth opportunities resulting from an over-inflated property market, Canada could have created a couple new cities on the border with the US with advanced transport connections. Something the Chinese do and it works. 

Imagine a couple well planned new cities with modern airports and connected to the US by maglev railways? Imagine having the Chinese effectively paying for it? You could even have a theme for each city: one could be Asia world and located in BC; another could be European themed and built by the Germans and Scandinavians and have the best design. Time for Canadians to get an imagination and get outside of the box."

2583,"I request the following on behalf of the City of Homer residents:

1) An immediate campaign to proclaim Homer an American City open for business and tourism with a respect for law and order is required to overcome this obstacle.

2) The Bible says to cast out the contentious person and the strife will cease. The sponsor(s) be removed from the city council and sued to repay for the labor and time and defamation of character to the image and mission of the City of Homer. It will rid the council of these individuals determined to destroy our economy by reckless endangerment and hold them accountable for their actions.
Excerpts from the Letter to the Editor by Patrick Brown ( can be read online)  
I have lived in Homer since 1991. This is what is driving this ""machine"" for ""recall"" because the bible tells them so.
The City Council members get to volunteer to administer to the city needs . They are NOT ""career"" politicians and are happy they serve the community. They are nice folks is all."
2584,"I assume you are an American. (If wrong, please correct me.) As such, you probably have little appreciation of the significance of the tango to Argentine culture. There is nothing wrong with dance incorporated into worship--Africans in particular hardly worship without it! But cultural accommodations need to fit the culture and one ""size"" does not fit all. What has meaning in Africa or in Japan or in Argentina does not necessarily work in Boston or Podunk or Guatemala.

If you don't make enough to qualify for an ACA plan, then you should qualify for Medicaid. Yes, premiums have gone up, but so has the advanced premium tax credit. Basically, the APTC is a tax credit the ACA policy holder receives before the premium is due, which largely offsets the premium. Only about 12% of ACA plan holders do not receive the tax credit. Sure, you can find the odd policy holder that's not as well off, but that's the exception. The best approach is to fix the problems, not get rid of a program that's benefitting the vast majority."

2616,"Are you Discojoe's cousin?

LBJ was one of the greatest legislative presidents we've ever had -- e.g. The 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Vietnam unfortunately was an important part of LBJ's failed legacy.

To Trump's credit he is not ignoring the existential threat posed to Japan, the RoK, Australia, and the U.S. by the DPRK, nor is he blind to the PRC aggression in the South China Sea.

But Trump's alienation of Merkel and Macron is undermining U.S. security.  If Trump is not willing to support Article 5, then why should France or Germany or any other NATO country support the U.S. if it gets into a military confrontation with the PRC and/or the DPRK, which is an increasingly likely scenario?

In short, you are correct.  Trump is a boor and his bad manners as well as his myopic strategic vision are hurting U.S. interests, especially with respect to our national defense."

2618,"You say ""volunteering"", but their prez said ""inviting"".

Your earlier post here certainly would lead one to believe that you are ready for the US to just lie back and let everyone else do the work for us.

Your list is also intriguing.  

You do understand that our ""self-defense"" requires copious amounts of fossil fuel and mineral resources, not to mention a huge chunk of taxpayer dollars.

You do understand that bringing manufacturing back to the US means either investing in clean energy/practices or wearing gas masks a la the Chinese.

You do understand that had we stayed on top of our infrastructue in the first place we wouldn't have the daunting project we are looking at today.  This is the sort of habitual neglect that tells the tale.

How about a toileting analogy, because here we agree. 

 The French are the perfect choice.  You see, over there they have something called a bidet.  

No doubt they will do a better job of wiping up after us than we are willing to do for ourselves."

2623,"Any thoughts 2016's Rule 5 draft surprise could repeat his charmed year went out the window. Though desperately needing a starter, looks like he's not going to fit the bill.

While Mickey & Goofy celebrated in the 4th inning that maybe after leaving 7 on-base in the first 3, that he'd be a real Genie to strand the 2 they were looking at. The three run HR occurred in the next breath, and now losing 7 of 9 -- Boston up next!

What a treat to listen to Orel Hershizer on the Dodger game that followed. Even without Vin in the booth, there's announcers that are full of game insights and meaningful analysis. Mickey & Goofy are the epitome of laziness and redundancy, not content with just repeating each other's stereotypical clichés, but offering little more than reading the media guide from cover to cover, and reciting the 60 pages given to them before every game by the teams' PR staff.

If you seriously believe a Liberal voter would either vote against the party, or abstain from voting against a cpc that has a harper clone in charge,and with harper's old cadre in his shadow - you are really not thinking logically.

And Canadians feel very strongly about the Charter and about the Supreme Court - strongly positive. If you seriously doubt that then you need to broaden your circle considerably. At least come out of the basement."

There is another phrase, the crucial phrase in the statute as far as Fredo is concerned and which you are selectively ignoring, and that phrase  is “other thing of value.” Information is an “other thing of value.” 

 “To the extent you’re using the resources of a foreign country to run your campaign — that’s an illegal campaign contribution,” according to Nick Akerman, an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation who now specializes in data crime.

Here’s the second important passage of the statute: “No person shall knowingly solicit, accept, or receive from a foreign national any contribution or donation.” The word ""solicit"" is why it doesn’t matter if Fredo actually got useful information. The part that’s illegal is trying to acquire information from a foreign source, whether or not the solicitation is  successful."

Thanks to EPA Seward Ships Drydock's dumping of toxic sandblast waste and clouds of toxic sandblast dust were eliminated and we now have responsible new operators at the shipyard.

2757,"I have written several times in several fora--including Civil Beat--about the reasons why I think a third option should also be considered to either 1) perpetuation of the Hawaiian Electric utiities as forever customer-subsidized so-called ""for profit"" monopolies (and possibly taxpayer-subsidized as well, as the HEI utiliities scratch and claw to continue paying adequate dividends to their sharehholders, and obscenely excessive salaries to their executives, as HEI struggles in vain to avoid or delay its inevitable death spiral, or 2) conversion of the HEI utiities to non-profit customer and/or taxpayer ownership.  This third option would be intentional acceleration of the HEI death spiral by actively assisting all HEI customers to become as energy self-sufficient as possible, as rapidly as possible, on the most decentralized basis possible--which I think will become increasingly tech feasible AND cost effective moving forward, and well before our goal of 100% ""renewable"" energy by 2045"

2774,"When will you people learn? Liberals are not loyal to Canada.
Nothing Liberals have ever done has benefited Canadians.
They create monopolies, increase taxes then use them for other pet projects, remove rights,sell off our land or give it away, flood us with other cultures and play divide and conquer with race, gender and religion.
They have no problem targeting children with propaganda IN OUR SCHOOLS!  
They are Soviets in all but name."
2775,"May I share some thoughts as someone involved with Pick Click Give? First of all, thank you for your donations to nonprofits! Regarding the 7% fee - When you use a credit card, write a check or use cash to donate directly to a nonprofit, you might not see the costs associated with the items listed above (advertising, printing, website, staff, etc,) but the nonprofit is paying them, usually at a much higher rate. 

The 7% fee goes towards the support of statewide marketing program, web site maintenance, donor correspondence lists, and technical training for nonprofits. It also goes towards tangible promotional items like banners and rack cards. Ask the nonprofit you give to why they participate in the Pick.Click.Give. program. The return on investment they receive on the 7% fee is incredible."

2785,"When BC is starving to death they will allow a pipeline. 
When the USA places their duties of 50-70% on their clear cut lumber / forced to spend 100 million on sewage treatment because they can't unleash all their feces into the ocean.....yep, likely the hypocrites will need a little starvation before coming to their senses. Thats when we can get it to the asian markets. If this turns ugly for Canada it will be a matter of months before we are in deep trouble."
2786,"The color of the school is not material. The facts are simple:
- People, even children, have a constitutional right to freedom of expression
- Schools may intrude on this right where needed to serve the educational purpose of the environment, but no more than the absolute bare minimum necessary intrusion can be tolerated (see the Freedom of Expression Ombudsman's articles on the topic)
- Hair rules, of any kind, are neither minimal nor necessary -they are all unconstitutional and only  survive because they are not challenged enough.
- The cause measureable harm to students - actually undermining the educational purpose of the school.
-To make all this worse, they tend to have racist outcomes (regardless of intentions or the color of the rulemakers)

They are unjustifiable acts of authoritarianism. Opposing them is a good thing.

As for my childhood - if I feel motivated to protect others from the injustices I have experienced, how is this a bad thing ? It's just the golden rule."

2795,"Speaking of Pipes and Dreams, it looks like the lying and disingenuous Justin Trudeau is not backing up his own promise to decriminalize marijuana. Those disenfranchised youth that voted for him based on that promise alone will be mad as a bunch of hornets come election time. Talk about Pipe Dreams.

Me, I knew Trudeau was a lying sack of $ hit the momeent he yelled out BullSh** at the top of his lungs in the HOC. Justin Trudeau is a Drama Queen and would never have been elected for anything were it not for his last name. Too bad for all thos unsuspecting liberal voters and especially too bad for Canada.

2803,"""Under the first step, the federal cultural agency had announced that by 2019 half of the projects it produces would be directed by women and half of the money it spends on films would go to projects directed by women.""

Hello, Justin Trudeau? I am okay with the federal group doing that, as long as the Feds plan in 2019 to also do the following:

1. Distribute, to only male nurses, one half of all dollars paid to all nurses in Canada, and
2. Distribute, to only male elementary school teachers, one half of all dollars paid to all elementary school teachers in Canada.

So please, Justin, go ahead with your Film Board's plan, just so long as you also cover the nurse and teacher situations.

However, if you choose NOT to do the nurse and teacher thing, well, in that case your Film Board plan amounts to an unfair and sexist and regressive abomination of justice, and you ought to be ashamed of your disgraceful and extremely unethical behavior in the area of gender matters in Canada."

2859,"An important part of this, is that the affordable housing requirements in Downtown / SLU are so low, in some areas as little as 2% of the units would be required to be affordable.  

https://outsidecityhall.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/even-raging-grannies-cant-convince-council-to-do-the-right-thing-in-downtownsouth-lake-union-rezone/

Johnson's justification for allowing the richest of developers to contribute the least, was that the low requirements would encourage already permitted projects to opt in.  Then he gave a misleading press release, when the reality is much less impressive.  But we are still stuck with this legislation that is a total corporate giveaway to richest developers while pushing the burden onto everyone else.

Thanks to George Howland and Councilmember Lisa Herbold for exposing this and to Seattle Weekly for sharing this story."
2860,"""It's pretty clear that Loretta Lynch and Barack Obama set up Don, Jr.""

Concentrate upon the legal immigration process versus the illegal immigration process, and stop pretending that they are one in the same, OK?

What matters, bottom line, is assimilation, that is, those that wish to assimilate unto our Nations values and laws, and those that do not.

Assimilation means not only believing within this Nation, but defending its own ideology.

It does NOT mean flying the flag of their own country of origin, or the ideology of the country of origin all the whilst taking advantage of the freedoms and benefits that this Nation has to offer them.

The ""ladder"", as you call it, Catherine, shall always be there, should the individual that climbs it, wishes that upon the top rung, they shall be called, and represented, as an American, not a hyphenated version of it, not as an expatriate from any other location, but as an American.

Period.

You, Catherine, accentuate the ""hyphen"" before American.

The LPC should have won by a greater margin of votes /w   Justin Trudeau as their leader, The LPC not only ran a better campaign, they also had very favorable coverage (overall) in the election.    Stephen Harper as a 9 year incumbent who wasn't particularly well liked, and that the majority of the electorate had grown tired of suggests that  the LPC should have won by a greater margin.. and that is a concern for their strategists because it indicates that the LPC is not the dominant party of old even with a very relatable leader going up against a tired old incumbent that was disliked."

Do you know that Canada has run a trade deficit with Mexico every year since NAFA was signed? You still think NAFTA is such a great for Canada???

I would be lying if I didn't have at least a sliver of skepticism regarding what will happen vis a vis gov't spending under a Trump admin--he doesn't exactly strike me as a ""small gov't"" type.

But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt until he acts otherwise. If he acts on the rhetoric he's promoted throughout his campaign, he'll get some spending room. If he backpedals on his promises, he will be roundly excoriated, have no doubt.

The last thing Trump needs to do is promote ""yes men"", as you say. What he does need is individuals with the experience he lacks, BUT who still support the same ideological goals as he. That means keeping out the Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld types and vaporizing any chance of their neocon aspirations to take hold.

I agree, it will not take long to see the impact of a Trump presidency. I am hopeful the promises will be delivered. And yes, we will be more divisive than ever. :-)"

Certainly the contents of the real emails should be scrutinized and published if they are incriminating in any way. But until the real ones can be separated from fake ones, that's certainly not a wise thing to do at this point, is it?

""That's ignoring basic capitalism""-. ""Everything is becoming polluted"". ""The world is cleaner now than it was 60 years ago and is getting cleaner each day""-. ""Competition is bad"". ""Competition builds innovation""-. All but a rare few altruistic actions are selfish. One doesn't help another person without some expectation of reward, even as simple as a thank you. So you trying to make it a better place is simply fulfilling your own selfish ends. Be it promoting your political ideals, your ideal economy, or even your ideal living spaces. It is without merit and without demonstration. Socialism is at its core the equal sharing of misery and nothing more."

As Browne describes in his autobiography Against the Tide, Archbishop John Charles McQuaid “considered the health scheme an encroachment by the state on the church’s role, which he considered to be, among much else, ‘to determine and to control the social attitudes of the family in the Republic, especially in the delicate matters of maternity and sexuality’.” Within months the church crushed the scheme and Browne was hounded out of the government. Labour Party leader William Norton scandalously sided with the church against Noël Browne and the Mother and Child Scheme. The Irish Trades Union Congress initially supported the Scheme but retreated once the bishops denounced it."""

3328,You do all the right things with your health and still get cancer .  A lot of people who eat poorly and don't exercise have health insurance through their employer already so it's not just people who have to buy their own health insurance have a monopoly on a bad life style . When you buy health insurance the money you put in isn't enough to cover all your bills if you get sick . Insurance companies use the money from other people's premiums to pay your doctor bills . You see the whole concept of insurance is a Socialist program of the many taking care of the few .

3337,"What law other than the Johnson Amendment ""requires"" churches to remain out of politics? Note that this law is rarely enforced anyway, so there is plenty of political activity in churches. I'm wondering where you get the idea that churches stay out of politics entirely - Hillary Clinton spoke at church services, including the Sunday before the election http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/11/06/hillary-clinton-speaks-at-philly-church/

If you look at history, tax exemptions for churches started pretty early - Virginia exempted churches from paying property taxes in 1777, followed by New York in 1799 and the city of Washington in 1802. The Seventh Congress also passed a property tax exemption in 1802. Churches were made officialiy exempt from income tax in 1894 when a federal income tax was first proposed http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/ArtWeb/CFFB1CE42BEFA8B285257BE400723DF8?OpenDocument"

3370,"Mr. Paliwoda, the Republican-led Congress has, in fact, passed lots of meaningful legislation in the two years since they've been in control.  According to www.govtrack.us, they've worked together to pass 219 bills that have become law.  Examples include bills to address the heroin/opioid epidemic, repeal No Child Left Behind, a long-term highway bill to give certainty to transportation infrastructure projects (and jobs), an FAA bill, a veteran suicide prevention bill, a permanent fix of the Medicare doctor reimbursement formula, an overhaul of the Toxic Substances Control Act to let EPA regulate more dangerous products like asbestos, made it harder for potential terrorists to get visas, and a lot more that you can find at https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/#bystatus.

And the physical sciences keep finding out their previous findings were wrong, and readjusting, too.

The current state of knowledge is that the jury is still out on a lot of things, and much of the data on both sides of the issue is debatable, so neither side should feel too confident, but clearly both nurture and nature play a role."

Courts don't issue ""rulings"" ... they issue ""opinions""...otherwise, we'd still have slavery.  And if ""respecting the courts rulings"" is all there is to it...then the Dred Scott case, the Fugitive slave act, fdr's EO 9066, are all still alive and well.  (Hmm, seems the federal COURTS don't even respect their own decisions!)  As far as Trump's pardoning...I refer you TO the Constitution, Article II, Section 2, Clause 1.

Not so much expensive ""pioneering"" when you use an existing ROW.  And at least the money is staying in Alaska and being used for a popular event that brings worldwide attention to Alaska.

Today's women are strong and educated like no other time in our countries history .   While of course it takes two to tango ,  why are so many women saying yes to something they should say no to unless they use protection ?  Women can change the whole situation if they choose to.  Instead , abortion has become the easy / lazy way out.  Every one of us commenting on this subject are lucky our mom's made the choice they did .The subject hit close to home when my mom told me  that had abortion been easily available in her mom's day , she would be here.

Nor is it unrealistic or unreasonable to OUTLAW possession of invasive felines from the Islands.  HI already does this for snakes, many species of which are valued PETS, BTW.  Just as mongooses are outlawed from the mainland because of their potential destructiveness should they become invasive.  When I was a kid US zoos couldn't even have them.

Immigration here was always set up to be immigrants who added to our country, skills, lifestyles, whse culture aligned with our American culture and English speaking was a critical role there.

Refugees were established for those people who were being persecuted and killed. That included refugees from the Middle East-it began with a focus on rescuing Christians and bringing them here. I know one such family from Iran...but they are not 'white'-

Greater than 50% is my guess. The lottery system curtails the numbers which some believe is necessary in order to not flood our cities with immigrants and there is a strong argument for limiting numbers. However, the discrimination expressed in this bill will favor whites over people of color and don't expect exceptions for technologically savvy south Asians. Their skin color will be a barrier. Only when large corporations take control of this and argue that immigration is needed to keep our economy growing will anyone in Congress pay attention. Right now they are catering to their base which is comprised of those who are afraid of anyone different from themselves and want those 'others' excluded. Insofar as 'foreigners' taking American's jobs too many Americans have no desire to learn new skills."

(2) Neither Abraham, Ishaaq nor Jacob knew the Name YHWH--they knew Him as ""El-Shaddai'"" (God Almighty--Ex. 6:3).

(3) Because there is only One Being Who has access to the human heart, you simply aren't qualified to TELL me or anyone else what is my or their INTENTION when we offer worship to our Creator.  My sincere INTENTION is to worship Abraham's GOD, besides Whom there is no other.  And I invoke Him by the Name ALLAH, as your gospel claims Jesus (alayhis-Salaam) did from the cross.

(3) The MOST you can do is argue that I'm addressing him by the proper Name.  ""And ALLAH will judge between you concerning that about which ye differed."" (Al-Ma'idah 48)."

Since the government won't tax the wealthy, or even impose surtaxes on multi-million dollar properties, we don't have the money even to fix the plumbing in public housing. What does the uber-rich CIBC exec suggest we do to make rents affordable??? Lots of anger on both sides of the question, but no real suggestions for how to approach the problem."

Tell me how many more times are we counseled to pray for the repose for the soul of innocent children, people who came to their house of prayer to worship?  People having a night out to enjoy the music they love and to have a good time?  Enacting laws against mindless mass shootings has to happen.  Make it sooner, rather than have more of these terrible tragedies."

3826,"Thanks GL.

The NOAA >1880 chart showing greater numbers of severe storms before and after the IR/fossil fuel boom is still hard to ignore. 

And due to the lack of recorded data before the late 19th century, sediment data appears to be the best method in determining the frequency and severity of storms <1880.

On a side note- I found it interesting how back in 2002 that NYT's story actually treated the sediment study's findings- which would go against today's GW narrative- with respect.   

Ah the good old days..."

Unfortunately, the Americans are trying to prop up this dying sector with subsidies for their bogus ""reliability"" and contribution to ""national security"". Time to resist and renew.

Thankfully coal is a minuscule part of Canada's energy mix."

3835,"here people can present fake comments because they can hide behind fake names.  when the commentator is known, the audience can better select with which to identify or not.  this is one of the main causes of the mis-directions in today's fragile and often chaotic thinking processes of our society!  simply parroting or re-hashing what someone else has said is NOT FACTUAL unless it is verifiable and quotable with footnotes - like in college!  like the lady said - we had to show all our work in deriving any math solution.  in trig class we had to cite the proper axiom and /or corollary to substantiate our methodology.  in expository writing we had to cite the source, any source, properly and accurately.  written project or job specifications all had to be checked, re-checked and re-checked again before being submitted to bid RFP's.  despite all the haste in getting the job out, correctness could not eliminated for the sake of expediency!  this applies to knee-jerk responses also!"

3841,"I guess you missed I was responding to this comment: ""With all the hate that goes with being trans don't you think that will cause some problems in the military as it does in the general public now?""

It's only you right-wingers that are oddly fixated on people's genitalia and bathroom issues and what's proper room for what. Nobody else cares. 

Like I said in another comment, I'm a mountain climber. On a glacier rope team, if someone has to go, they don't untie from the rope and find privacy. Male or female you drop your drawers and take care of business right there in front of your rope mates. I'm quite certain our military professionals are more than capable of handling a similar situation without having their delicate sensibilities offended like you right wingers do."
3842,what's this week's weather
3843,"Cycling is extremely hazardous for the lungs, with ozone effect, diesel fumes, car, and bus exhaust carrying dust into the air, un-burnt gas, and oil from scooters, the cigarette smoke coming from cars, micro glass from the asphalt, dust from construction, and smog can ruin a ride."
3844,"It's challenging for me to understand how we need this wood burning plant on the Big Island with the recent advances in solar battery technology. HELCO is certainly aware of the Blue Ion batteries both in production and nearing production that could not only produce the power but could also produce clean burning hydrogen which could replace propane. There are always stories of failed business plans and allowing this to go forward has the earmarks of a bailout for the owners of 30,000 acres of eucalyptus. I read the State and County have 10,500 acres. Is it KS with the other 20,000? I can't wait for the public hearing on this."

3864,"So the suggestion that the son was abused, in your opinion, changes his actions just how?  He 'intentionally', with forethought, stood hiding with a loaded weapon and when opportunity arose, fired intentionally.  Three men struggling, seven shots rapidly fired, and only two men hit and murdered.  Certainly not an easy task for someone who is overcome with emotion and mentally unstable because shot placement like that requires clarity of thought.

If nothing else, any paternal abuse should have inclined him to shoot all three and then his 'abuse' problems would be over.  Unless you are suggesting a ""stockholm syndrome"" possibility.  Then there is the attention to other details like drawing and staging the troopers guns and removing the pot, which of course has nothing to do with the story because it's use is strictly benign.

Yes you are correct, some of us will disagree with your opinion that he should have been treated differently but I doubt that will make any difference to the Dead!"

3896,"Strongly agree Julie. Sadly VAC is missing on a few things and one of them is care for PTSD veterans. The charities, especially WWC are filling gaps in the available care and giving a chance at rehab to veterans who, very understandably, lack the ability and emotional resources to battle VAC. These people are suffering debilitating injuries suffered as a result of a tremendously difficult workplace. How is it possible that VAC isn't covering them adequately? And I agree with you, it's great to see at least some of them doing great work AND being responsible with the donation $$"

3909,"Statues are for heroes. When you erect statues of villains you glorify their accomplishments as heoic. The primary accomplishment of the confederacy and its leaders who are now enshrined in statuary around the South was to secede and start a civil war with America for the purpose of retaining slavery against an entire race. By glorifying that, those who erected and those who support them today are tacitly stating that if we had our way we would again endeavour to return to those days of total white race dominance. Of course we can't, so we have these statues in our public places to tell the world what we still believe in. These bigoted white supremacists who took up arms in the name of slavery are our heroes. Surely the southern states have other truly noble humanitarian heroes who's stories would be better told in the public parks throughout the south than these abhorrent symbols of apartheid and racial cruelty."

3917,"Those most in favour of controlling what others say are the first to blather that freedom of speech is not some inalienable right but I disagree with their sentiment. Canada already has very clear laws governing slander, liable and hate. If someone....anyone.....wishes to convey or express an opinion within the context of those laws then public officials like Mr Robertson should respect that right."
3918,"There are historical precedents for states ignoring federal law.  It is called Nullification and was promulgated in political theory by notorious racist and secessionist John C. Calhoun.  Interesting that today's Democrats are using this Democrat's racist political theory to back up their sanctuary cities.  Just like a leopard cannot change its spots, today's Democrats cannot change their racist ways."
3919,"Is there a top-up feature, if there isn't a lot of money left?"
3920,"The vast majority of human traffic is comprised of travelers - who need to get to terminals/gates through three (but going to be two when the A terminal walkover bridge closes) choke points. It's the TSA security theater/cluster contributing to the delays. Get people into the terminals, and if you really want to whiz away money on a construction project, build some walkways/escalators to let people travel between terminals outside of the train system. People don't have time to dink around outside of the terminals at DIA, that is just stupid to think otherwise, obvious to the casual observer when viewing the Disneyland-like lines on Sunday mornings. Some other airports have more dining options on the outside, but that's mainly due to the lack of options in the gate area. I would never, ever plan on eating outside the terminal area at DIA due to the high variability in screening time, even with pre-check status."

3923,"Try and see it from that public board's stance.

People forget that there wasn't a Catholic school there in the first place.  The Catholic board shut down their only school years ago, so the public school was the only functioning school in that district.  The public board made long term plans, around closures around amalgamation, plans that take YEARS to come to fruition, and then out of nowhere the Catholic board leaps BACK into a district they'd already abandoned, with a brand new school.

Why should the public board be happy that their budgets and long term plans just got shafted with an out-of-left-field move like this?  The Catholic board and those parents have the right, but they had to expect resistance.  The quotes in the piece where the Catholic board members are astounded that this became legal make me laugh.  Really?"

I don't know anybody that can do that - they all have to buy something on a regular basis - drivers licence, tires, gas/diesel, propane, salt, sugar, etc, etc.

Sadly - and I mean that - you're still on the hook for fuel taxes, property taxes, GST/PST/HST, fees, surcharges, fines, bank fees, etc, etc.

3955,What people are not doing is facing facts.  Obamacare isn't working.  What the Republicans have proposed probably isn't much different.  What the Republicans have talked about but didn't propose is needed - like opening it up for insurance carries to cross state lines.  If Americans would stop and ponder the long-term issues of government controlling health insurance.  Helping those who cannot afford insurance should be covered and those who can afford - even if they need to work two jobs need to pay part or all of their health care.  Not sure what has happened to this country but it used to be take care of yourself - not any more people are looking for handouts.  Our country has lost that drive to achieve on their own.
