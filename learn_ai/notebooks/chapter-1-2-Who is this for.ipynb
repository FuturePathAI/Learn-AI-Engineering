    "## What we assume you know\n",
    "This course is structured around the assumption that you are a proficient engineer first, which means you are able to reason about deterministic systems despite their complexity. We assume you're proficient in at least one of Python or JS and can deploy a simple GET with \"Hello World\" over REST in less than 10 minutes of effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What we focus on\n",
    "1. Experiential Teaching: Examples and use cases which we have seen ourselves but that is nowhere exhausted compared to what you might see on the job depending on your specialization. \n",
    "2. Text-first: We focus a lot more on text than vision, sound, audio or video at least at the moment. This is partially because most enterprise applications of Generative AI today are text first. "
